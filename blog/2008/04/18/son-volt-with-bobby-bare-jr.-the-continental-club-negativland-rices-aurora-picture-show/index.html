            id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5190600061235661730" border="0" /></a><br />I caught a couple of great shows the past
    two days. Wednesday night, I went to see <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sonvolt">Son Volt</a> at The Continental
    Club. For those who are not familiar with the band, Jay Farrar the lead singer/song writer, was previously in Uncle
    Tupelo (forefathers of the "No Depression"/alt-country genre) and one of my favorite bands - <a
        href="http://www.myspace.com/wilco">Wilco</a>. There was a bit of a falling out between him and Jeff Tweedy
    during the recording of the epic "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" album and Son Volt was born. Son Volt put on a great show.
    Their lead guitar player was a virtuoso, playing flawlessly with perfect tone.<br /><br /><a
        href="http://www.myspace.com/bobbybarejr">Bobby Bare Jr</a> opened. I hadn't heard of him previously but really
    liked his songs. The bass player was hilarious. He had on a "Daniel-san" like headband and danced around like he was
    playing butt rock rather than sensitive alt-country. He cracked me up when he asked for "more mustache" in the
    monitors!<br /><br />Last night, I had the pleasure of experiencing <a
        href="http://www.myspace.com/officialnegativland">Negativland</a> at <a
        href="http://www.aurorapictureshow.org/">Rice's Aurora Picture Show</a> after a friend invited me to check it
    out. The show can best be described as a fictional radio show examining religion. The show was titled "It's All In
    Your Head" and posits that religion, like everything else, is man made. By design, it is intended to make listeners
    question their beliefs and compare/contrast them with other religions. To enhance the listening experience, the
    audience was given a colorful piñata blindfold and invited to wear it throughout the show. I took their suggestion
    and zoned out a bit as I soaked up the chaotic sound collage they created live on stage. One of the members of the
    group said no computers were used to produce the show, just an array of electronics equipment including samplers,
    turntables, and other "complicated devices". This was very different than anything I'd ever been to but I thoroughly
    enjoyed it.<br /><br />Before the show, we wandered around the Rice campus a bit until we found <a
        href="http://valhalla.rice.edu/">Valhalla</a>, an on-campus bar run by grad students. The beer was ridiculously
    cheap. I drank St. Arnold Bock for $1.15 a glass. I'll always love the Gingerman, but I may have found another
    option when in that area. The campus was beautiful. I'd never been there, but walking around made me want to go back
    to school again. Maybe someday soon. The whole studying thing doesn't appeal to me at the moment.<br /><br />I'm
    supposed to be working now, so I'd better wrap this up. I've included a picture I took in a friend of a friend's
    apartment building. I think it speaks for itself.</div>
