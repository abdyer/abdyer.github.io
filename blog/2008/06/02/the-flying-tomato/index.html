since my last post. If I actually had some readers, this would be a bad thing. But since I don't, I guess it doesn't

Actually, I don't need anyone to make me feel good about myself, but it would be nice to know you're reading
this.<br><br>I, like hundreds of other people yesterday ventured out to Bayou Park for the grand opening of the
<a href=http://www.houstontx.gov/parks/lee-joepark.html>Lee and Joe Jamail Skate Park</a>. For those of you who
haven't been following its construction, this is a FREE public skate park just outside of downtown. I dabbled in
skateboarding back in 6th & 7th grade and still hop on my board from time to time to ride back and forth like
I'm cool. I really feel like the old guy at the skate park, but the kids don't seem to mind and I try to stay out of
their way. I didn't skate yesterday, and instead joined the crowd around the side of the "expert" bowl. We were
treated to demos by some of the top pro skaters, most of whom I didn't recognize since I followed the sport much
more closely "back in the day". But none other than <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White>Shaun White
(Olympic gold medal snowboarder, aka The Flying Tomato)</a> was there only on a skateboard. I felt very
privileged to see him in action. Awesome!<br><br>In other news, Jamie and I saw the Old 97's at Meridian on
Friday. They played a bunch of songs from their new album. There was even a wedding proposal on stage during the
sugary sweet "Question". I'm liking their new album more and more each time I listen to it.<br><br>I also saw
the new <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/>Indiana Jones movie</a> over the weekend. It fit nicely with
the others and seemed to prepare Shia LaBeouf to take on the role of Indy in the next movie. I guess we'll see. My
only beef with the movie was the odd ending, but it is George Lucas, after all.<br><br>I finally managed to try
some of <a href=http://www.southernstarbrewery.com/>Southern Star Brewing'</a>s beer at <a href=http://www.beerknurd.com/>The Flying Saucer</a> over the weekend. Southern Star is a new brewery up near
Conroe that was started by a guy I know from my homebrew club and one of his friends. I tried their <a href=http://www.southernstarbrewery.com/SSBBeers.asp>Pine Belt Pale Ale</a> and really liked it. Hop nectar,
for sure. Good luck, guys!<br><br>Back to work...</div></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/05/07/thoughts-on-30/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
