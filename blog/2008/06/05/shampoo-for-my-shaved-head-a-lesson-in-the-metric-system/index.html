    Today I stopped by my local Sport Clips to get some more shampoo. Yes, even shaved heads need to be washed with
    quality shampoo. Trust me, it's that much more important when people can see every inch of your scalp. I go with the
    <a href="http://www.paulmitchell.com/Products/TeaTree/Care/Pages/TeaTreeSpecialShampoo.aspx">Paul Mitchell Tea Tree
        stuff</a>. At first, I liked it for the tingly sensation, but I guess my head is way too cool for that now
    because I don't feel a thing when I use it. But my hair always looks great (ha ha ha, I know) so I continue using
    it.<br /><br />As I perused the shampoo selection and various sizes, I noticed a 1L mega size alongside my usual
    500ml size. Since there were no prices on them, I asked the girl behind the counter what the price difference was
    between the two sizes. She told me, and even though the larger size contained twice as much as the other size, the
    price was a little less than double. I said something along those lines more to myself than to her and she said,
    "No, it's three times the shampoo." I was a bit confused by her statement because I learned the metric system in
    elementary school and 1L = 1000ml = 2 x 500ml. I pointed this out and she said, "Hmm, I learn something new every
    day." To downplay my intellectual superiority and to make her feel better for not knowing, I said, "Well, if you
    tell people it's three times as much, maybe you'll sell more." Now I wonder to myself whether she'll do just that or
    try to impress people with her newfound knowledge of the metric system...</div>
