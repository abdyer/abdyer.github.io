Shake your head and say it couldn&rsquo;t happen to you. I thought the same thing until it did. Normally, I keep my phone in one of my front pockets, but I was wearing a coat that covered the pocket, making it a bit more difficult to grab my phone quickly to check Google Maps. Since my coat has a side access pocket in the chest, I stowed my phone there while walking around. I&rsquo;m guessing a skillful thief at the last bar spotted my phone in that side pocket and was able to slide it out without me knowing. I was in a crowded room and often looking to one side as I talked to different people. Self-shaming thoughts aside, sometimes it happens.</p><blockquote><p>Pro Tip: When traveling abroad, keep your main SIM card with your luggage at your hotel/rental. Buy a local SIM if possible for faster data. Losing my phone but not my main SIM card made a bad situation a bit better.</p></blockquote><p>Once I noticed my phone was missing, I faced all manner of unusual challenges. Did I remember the address of my AirBnB flat? How will I wake up on time for my train in the morning without an alarm? How will I get to the train station? Luckily I was able to get back to the flat without a problem. I did wake up too late for my train the next morning, but had no problem navigating to the train station after checking the route on my laptop before leaving.</p><p>I arrived at the train station and learned that there was another train a couple hours later. Not bad. This gave me time to grab a flat white & croissant and then do some phone shopping. With the self-shaming level still high, I decided I didn&rsquo;t want to spend more than 200€ on a (possibly temporary) replacement. At that price level, a <a href=http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/android/GT-I9195ZKABTU>Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini</a> was pretty much my only choice. It shipped with KitKat (4.4.2) and withholding <a href=http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/nexusae0_182.png>Samsung&rsquo;s TouchWiz UI nonsense</a>, it&rsquo;s proven to be a pretty decent little phone. Installing the <a href=http://www.cyanogenmod.org/>CyanogenMod</a> 12 ROM got me a stock Android UI and that <a href=https://andydyer.org/images/lollipop.jpg>sweet, sweet Lollipop</a>.</p><p>The more technically savvy among you may ask whether I was able to track my device using the Android Device Manager. This is all it&rsquo;s shown for the past week:<br></p><img src=https://andydyer.org/images/android_device_manager.png alt="Android Device Manager" style=width:827px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block><br>After carrying the S4 Mini for a week, I've realized a few things:<ol><li>I miss small phones. I don&rsquo;t need a phone with a five inch screen for most things. I have an Android Wear watch, so a large portion of my interaction with my phone occurs via my wrist anyway.</li><li>Doing Android development on a flagship phone blinds us to what most of our users (even more so for global apps) are experiencing. Who has phones that old/small/underpowered? Most people.</li><li>Paraphrasing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YMNth3JF0M">Tyler Durden</a>, &ldquo;You are not your smart phone.&rdquo; Who cares what phone you have. A more interesting question is, &ldquo;What do you do with it?&rdquo;</li></ol><p>So why am I <a href=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unironically>unironically</a> carrying this small, older Android phone? I think it will help me build better apps. And it may annoy me just enough to spend less time on my phone and more time experiencing the world around me.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/02/08/mce-conference-2015-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
