    <p>I'm a bit late with my annual Top 10 list, but here it is roughly ranked by Google Music play count:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Earl Sweatshirt - I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside</strong> I was finally lucky enough to <a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/music/earl-sweatshirt-revels-in-raps-odd-future-at-warehouse-live-7746980">see him live</a> and he didn't disappoint. Another great release. This soundtracked numerous skateboard and chill sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Vince Staples - Summertime &lsquo;06</strong> His &ldquo;Hell Can Wait&rdquo; EP made my list last year and I knew this one would be on this year's list right away. The subject matter is heavy, but you may be nodding your head so much at first you won't notice. I recommend multiple listens so you can fully appreciate both its depth and undeniable crunkness.</li>
<li><strong>Drumcode - A-Sides Volume III</strong> Ever since getting bitten by the techno bug, I've compiled a solid list of podcasts I listen to regularly like <a href="http://www.droidbehavior.com/blog/podcast/">Droid Podcast</a> and Adam Beyer's <a href="http://drumcode.se/">Drumcode Radio (DCR)</a>. This collection of Drumcode singles includes many that were feature on DCR.</li>
<li><strong>Fuzz - II</strong> This Ty Segall side project returns with another face melting set. For when you want to rock. Hard.</li>
<li><strong>Ryan Adams - 1989</strong> I had successfully avoided knowingly hearing any of Taylor Swift's album until I heard this song-for-song cover album from the prolific Mr. Adams. Now I realize they've been plaguing my every shopping experience for months. But there's no way around it, these are good songs. I contend they're even better with Ryan Adams performing them.</li>
<li><strong>Panda Bear - Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper</strong> For the uninitiated, Panda Bear is a member of Animal Collective, a pretty kick ass indie psych band. This is his fifth solo album. Reverb, chants, and a masterful combination of Eastern &amp; electronic instruments pay tribute to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD4sxxoJGkA">Pet Sounds</a> and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Buxton - Half a Native</strong> Houston's Buxton delivers an album of honest and heartfelt songs. We've all been there, but when Sergio Trevino sings about shyly introducing himself to a woman in &ldquo;Pool Hall&rdquo;, you feel like you <em>are</em> there.</li>
<li><strong>Deerhunter - Fading Frontier</strong> Bradford Cox and crew continue their legacy of jangly rock songs that are hard to categorize, but always sound like Deerhunter.</li>
<li><strong>Car Seat Headrest - Teens of Style</strong> I owe this discovery to NPR All Songs Considered's coverage of the CMJ Music Festival. The young Will Toledo's bedroom recordings confirm he has another great album coming when he records in a proper studio in 2016.</li>
<li><strong>Wilco - Star Wars</strong> This Wilco album came out of nowhere&hellip;no press coverage, no teased release date&hellip;just a free download on the interwebz. Sure, it's another Wilco album, but one that I enjoyed a bit more than their last two.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiOTTgupZ1CBE0OdDyg1jOfQpwr0VlbA9">Here's a playlist</a> with one of my favorite songs from each album. Enjoy!</p>
