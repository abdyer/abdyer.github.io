For our purposes, a time traveler is someone who is more than 30 years older than their partner or 70 years older than their children (Egon didn&rsquo;t time travel, but Hannah did before their lovechild was born).</p><p>The code below is one way to implement this logic, but please let me know (or <a href=https://github.com/abdyer/family-tree-dsl/pulls>open a PR</a>) if you have suggestions for improving something:</p><script src=https://gist.github.com/abdyer/b2dccdaa6d08711820f8be174d1984bc.js></script><h4 id=who-is-their-own-ancestor>Who is their own ancestor?</h4><p>Such a weird thought, right? Once again, I&rsquo;m sorry to be the one to spoil this for you if you missed this juicy bit of the plot, but a couple people in the Dark family trees are their own ancestor. ðŸ¤¯ While the approach for identifying time travelers involved recursively mapping the tree, we&rsquo;ll need to collect the list of ancestors as we go to identify the self ancestors. We can do this with a <code>data class</code>, the <a href=https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/fold.html><code>fold</code> function</a>, and more recursion:</p><script src=https://gist.github.com/abdyer/386a793ca6b550a185b9cf033f567b7a.js></script><h4 id=the-big-reveal>The big reveal</h4><p>With the <code>main()</code> function below, we&rsquo;ll print the answers to our time traveler and self ancestor questions:</p><script src=https://gist.github.com/abdyer/7aa1b48481fc57b1051995c1bc0daa09.js></script><p>Which gives us:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>

And if anyone has the galaxy brain to correlate the family trees above with the image below, please be my guest. I suspect the loops match up with time travelers and partnerships in the tree, but did not come up with any defensible theories.</p><img src=https://andydyer.org/images/dark-loops.png alt="Dark family tree loops" style=width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/03/21/building-a-family-tree-dsl-with-jetpack-compose-syntax/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
