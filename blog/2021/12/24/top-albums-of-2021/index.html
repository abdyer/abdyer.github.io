Here&rsquo;s my list of favorite albums that soundtracked it all:</p><ol><li><strong>Mdou Moctar - Afrique Victime</strong> My first concert in over a year and a half, Mdou Moctar did not disappoint. While the guitar playing is undoubtedly the feature, be sure to appreciate the skill of the drummer as well.</li><li><strong>Night Beats - Outlaw RnB</strong> I&rsquo;ve been a Night Beats fan <a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/12/22/top-10-albums-of-2013/>for years</a> but until this album, I was convinced I preferred the psych rock of their first couple albums over their more recent soul/R&amp;B sound. This one grew on me more with each listen. They also released a great album of acoustic versions of these tracks and did a Levitation Sessions. I included a track from the latter on the playlist below.</li><li><strong>Fuzz - Levitation Sessions</strong> Just about any Levitation Sessions release makes for a great listen; most definitely this one. There was also a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9o_P9hKQGk">Part II of the OSees Levitation Sessions</a> released this year, but I resisted the urge to include it after having three of their albums on <a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2020/12/22/top-albums-of-2020/>last year&rsquo;s list</a>.</li><li><strong>Fruit Bats - Siamese Dream</strong> Siamese Dream is one of my all-time favorite albums. This cover album chills everything out and does every track well.</li><li><strong>Buck Meek - Two Saviors</strong> I surprised myself by how often I kept coming back to the Big Thief guitar player&rsquo;s second solo album. There&rsquo;s so much detail in the lyrics and the melodies are catchy enough to hum to yourself once they infect your subconscious.</li><li><strong>Floatie - Voyage Out</strong> Floatie immediately reminded me of Palm, another math-rock favorite of mine. I&rsquo;ve praised their label, <a href=http://www.explodinginsoundrecords.com/>Exploding in Sound Records</a>, more than once over the years and Floatie is another good example of the kind of sound I like to have exploding in my vicinity.</li><li><strong>Meatbodies - 333</strong> Does this sound an awful lot like Fuzz? Yes, and that&rsquo;s precisely why I like it.</li><li><strong>Na$ty - The Rodez Tapes</strong> While we patiently await new Kendrick & Earl Sweatshirt albums, Na$ty was a new discovery for me that scratches a similar hip-hop itch. Boasts like &ldquo;So ahead of my time I wrote this rhyme last week&rdquo; flow effortlessly over laid-back lo-fi beats. Dig it.</li><li><strong>Charley Crockett - 10 for Slim & Music City USA</strong> This year gave us a couple batches of new-but-retro-sounding country songs from Mr. Crockett. I&rsquo;d love to see him live, but tickets are over $100 each! Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a copy of each on vinyl and some good whiskey for a night in instead.</li><li><strong>Wednesday - Twin Plague</strong> There&rsquo;s always something shoegazey on this list and Wednesday fills that role this year. Droning, swooping, fuzzed out guitars alternating in a loud/quiet dynamic. Yep, this&rsquo;ll do nicely.</li></ol><p>Here&rsquo;s a playlist with a song from each of the above albums:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLiOTTgupZ1CDj25VbQEqSPX0yOX6YzSpn" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/05/01/spoiling-the-dark-plot-with-kotlin/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
