While past favorites Kendrick Lamar & Earl Sweatshirt both released long-awaited albums, I did not find myself returning to them the way I did with their previous releases.</p><p>This list is probably the first that has included a new mix of an album that was released in a different year (The Beatles - Revolver), but I think it sounds so modern, its inclusion is defensible. And it&rsquo;s my list, so my rules, right?</p><ol><li><strong>Spoon - Lucifer on the Sofa</strong> This was easily my most listened. It&rsquo;s yet another Spoon album (in the best way possible), but this one was made for playing live.</li><li><strong>Big Thief - Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You</strong> This album won me over after years of being aware of Big Thief, but not really considering myself a fan. It shows so many different sides of the band; there&rsquo;s something here for everyone.</li><li><strong>The Black Angels - Wilderness of Mirrors</strong> Austin&rsquo;s psych rock heroes return with so many great songs. I need to visit <a href=https://levitation.fm/>Levitation</a> to catch them live again soon. The last time was in <a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2009/04/19/bands-ive-seen-live>2013</a>!</li><li><strong>Kurt Vile - (watch my moves)</strong> Kurt Vile has a laid-back sound & style uniquely his own. Daydream fuel&mldr;if you know&mldr;whut I mean.</li><li><strong>Osees - A Foul Form</strong> Predictably, I have an Osees/Oh Sees/OCS/Thee Oh Sees album on the list! The prog-rock sounds of the last few albums have been supplanted by thrash/skate punk. The harsh mix itself acts as an instrument to evoke raw punk rock on cassette. It&rsquo;s short enough to listen to twice in a row, which I did often.</li><li><strong>The Chats - Get Fucked</strong> Surf punk from Brisbane, Australia. Standout tracks include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBeu6wEZDqw">Panic Attack</a>-tack-tack-tack-tack-tack, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cawY4hXfe0o">The Price of Smokes</a> (the economy-minded sequel to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58V2vC9EPc">Smoko</a>) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrkuo0y8gMU">6L GTR</a>.</li><li><strong>Alex G - God Save the Animals</strong> An Alex G album also made it on the <a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2019/12/23/top-albums-of-2019/>2019 list</a>. This one has a lot of the same elements I appreciated on House of Sugar.</li><li><strong>Wilco - Cruel Country</strong> Wilco & country, what else do you need? This double album dials down the trademark Wilco mid-tempo ever so slightly most of the time, giving the listener time to feel the melancholy lyrics a bit more intensely.</li><li><strong>Oren Ambarchi, Johan Berthling & Andreas Werliin - Ghosted</strong> This discovery can most certainly be attributed to NPR Music, either the <a href=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/>All Songs Considered</a> or <a href=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/606254804/new-music-friday>New Music Friday</a> podcast. Percussive, minimal jazz to soundtrack heady conversations with yourself or others.</li><li><strong>The Beatles - Revolver (2022 Mix)</strong> What if The Beatles recorded an album with modern technology? Since we can&rsquo;t do that, what if we use modern technology to separate the instruments/voices from the source tapes and mix that, again with modern technology? <a href=https://www.npr.org/2022/10/28/1132221589/youve-never-heard-the-beatles-revolver-sound-like-this>This episode</a> of the aforementioned NPR All Songs Considered podcast explains how that works in more detail. The result is stunning to anyone who&rsquo;s fairly familiar with the 56 year old album.</li></ol><p>Here&rsquo;s a playlist with a song from each of the above albums:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLiOTTgupZ1CD3dfnT6rnxUYZ5PGXQEdZL" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/12/24/top-albums-of-2021/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
