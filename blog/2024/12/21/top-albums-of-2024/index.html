I saw him play yet again at the Gothic Theatre back in May.</p></li><li><p><strong>Osees - SORCS 80</strong> Not only did they release an album without any guitars on it, they also simultaneously released a live version (complete with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQZ3-ovNZQU">rooftop video</a>) of it! I saw their show at the Ogden Theatre in the fall. They didn&rsquo;t play a single track off this album, but gave the bouncing crowd a couple hours of everything else they&rsquo;ve released over the past several years.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jessica Pratt - Here in the Pitch</strong> The melody, reverb, and Pet Sounds style production on the opening track &ldquo;Life Is&rdquo; hooked me immediately. The album demands a rainy day and headphones in order to get properly acquainted. The styles vary throughout, but the introspective mood persists.</p></li><li><p><strong>DIIV - Frog in Boiling Water</strong> Shoegazy sounds are having a bit of a resurgence (hi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBjbNkGAESk">Wisp</a>). DIIV&rsquo;s latest certainly fits the moment, but its tracks explore the full range of the genre with a bit of grunge thrown in.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis - The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis</strong> Members of Fugazi plus some jazz musicians?! It&rsquo;s as thoroughly satisfying as it sounds.</p></li><li><p><strong>J.R.C.G. - Grim Iconic&mldr; (Sadistic Mantra)</strong> This band&rsquo;s sound is so dense and primal. I added it to my streaming music library after hearing a track on All Songs Considered and then forgot about it for a few days. When I eventually gave the album a listen, I kept thinking about how thoughtful my past self was to leave this gift for me. ü•∞ The only thing that diminished the joy of discovering this band was learning they had just played in Denver the night before. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></li><li><p><strong>Khruangbin - A LA SALA</strong> This band is so dependable that someone in the group is usually able to guess who it is within the opening seconds of most songs. This is a good thing, like tacos at your favorite spot, maybe &ldquo;a la salsa&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kendrick Lamar - GNX</strong> It is mandatory to have this surprise/late album drop in your best of list, so here it is. DAMN is still my favorite Kendrick album, but this one joins the short list.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vince Staples - Dark Times</strong> The other Compton rapper on the list and one who&rsquo;s been on a few of my favorite albums lists over the years. I appreciate the well-placed Eazy-E sample in &ldquo;Radio&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t generally like singing in my hip-hop, but Vince & Kendrick have been sneaking it in regularly enough to warm me up to it a little.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stress Eater - Everybody Eats!</strong> When I thought the year&rsquo;s new music was winding down, this Record Store Day release from Kool Keith & Czarface hit streaming services. INS is missing from this configuration, but it still fits nicely alongside other recent Czarface releases.</p></li></ol><p>Here&rsquo;s a playlist with a song from each of the above albums:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLiOTTgupZ1CCAVhEgzJKtf068qvy94fhF" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2023/12/22/top-albums-of-2023/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
