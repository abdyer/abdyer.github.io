      <description>I&#39;ve lived in Berlin for a bit more than six months now. Here&#39;s a list of some of the things I&#39;ve learned:
 It is possible to survive a summer without air conditioning. It&#39;s also possible to go all summer without a mosquito bite. I don&#39;t miss having a car. Public transit is great here so I typically only need one to haul things like furniture. And I can rent one on demand pretty easily with apps like DriveNow.</description>

      <description>Anyone who has talked to me for more than 10 minutes has probably heard me mention my love for Berlin. I first visited the city about six years ago and almost immediately resolved to make it my home one day. I&#39;m thrilled to finally announce that it&#39;s happening! I&#39;ll be joining Zalando in Berlin next month to do Android and hopefully step up my fashion game a bit. Radical Agility sounds like engineering nirvana to me!</description>
