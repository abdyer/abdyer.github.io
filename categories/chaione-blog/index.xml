As expected, we heard about the next release of the Android operating system, Android Wear smart watches, and updated development tools. Rumored products &amp;amp; services such as Android TV, Android Auto, and Google Fit were also announced. Perhaps the most exciting and far-reaching announcement was the new Material Design language, which replaces the now dated looking Holo with a consistent look for all platforms. Enterprise users can now securely separate work &amp;amp; personal data with the Android Work suite of services. Finally, Android Cardboard showed us how to make a DIY version of an Oculus Rift style VR headset.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
