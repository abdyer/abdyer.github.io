I never got around to finishing the transcript of the talk I intended to write, but you can find the slides on &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/abdyer/appcraft-faster-than-a-speeding-release-train">Speaker Deck&lt;/a> and the video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo45nwRxtik&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=20">YouTube&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When new technologies start gaining momentum in the Android community, the pragmatic (or lazy) among us eventually have to ask ourselves, “Is it worth it?” After the initial arrival and departure of the hype train, some of these become trusted tools we use in almost every app. Think &lt;a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://google.github.io/dagger/">Dagger&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native&lt;/a> may be on its way to earning a place in the same club. Once we get past the fact that JavaScript on Android and HTML in JavaScript seem pretty damn weird at first, there’s a lot to like. Seeing your changes on a device almost instantly is a love-at-first-sight kind of thing. And rethinking your app architecture as a series of actions, state changes, and UI render phases can eliminate a surprising number of silly bugs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiple Developers, One App: How to Not Break Everything</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2016/10/22/multiple-developers-one-app-how-to-not-break-everything/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2016 13:00:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2016/10/22/multiple-developers-one-app-how-to-not-break-everything/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was my third time attending the Big Android BBQ in Hurst, TX and my third time to present at it. Perhaps my favorite thing about the conference (aside from the obvious BBQ) is reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. This year I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of meeting people from all over the world and learning that we know a lot of the same people. Small world, indeed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things That Suck About Android Development</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2016/03/18/things-that-suck-about-android-development/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 13:17:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2016/03/18/things-that-suck-about-android-development/</guid><description>&lt;p>I presented &amp;ldquo;Things That Suck About Android Development&amp;rdquo; at this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://mdevcon.com/">mdevcon&lt;/a> conference in Amsterdam. It&amp;rsquo;s a great conference in an amazing city. I highly recommend it to anyone developing mobile apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The title is admittedly a bit sensational, but my goal was to highlight many of the painful parts about developing for Android and how to avoid/fix them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The slides are available &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/abdyer/things-that-suck-about-android-development">here on Speaker Deck&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MCE Conference 2015 - Automated Testing for Modern Android Applications</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/02/08/mce-conference-2015-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/02/08/mce-conference-2015-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was an honor to speak at and attend &lt;a href="http://mceconf.com/">MCE Conference&lt;/a> in Warsaw last week. I participated in a workshop where I learned about prototyping with Android and Arduinos. I attended talks about Groovy, Kotlin, Proguard, design, scaling apps for emerging markets, and some handy new libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That alone easily makes MCE one of the best conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. On top of all that, the networking with fellow speakers and attendees was a personal highlight. To everyone I met, I hope to stay in touch until our paths cross again. And I hope you caught up on your sleep!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BABBQ5 - Automated Testing for Modern Android Applications</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/10/17/babbq5-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/10/17/babbq5-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my third year to attend and present at the &lt;a href="http://www.bigandroidbbq.com/">Big Android BBQ&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://news.bigandroidbbq.com/2014/09/speaker-spotlight-andrew-dyer.html">My talk&lt;/a> this year showed how to prepare an Android app for automated testing using mocking, dependency injection, and Google&amp;rsquo;s super fast Espresso test runner.

I fell in love with the city on my first visit and the conference was a perfect reason for another visit. Attempts to try out my very basic German skills have shown me that I have a long way to go. However, I am proud to say that I have managed to make a few purchases without panicking and falling back to English.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Presenting: Wrist Presenter for Android and the Pebble Smartwatch</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/03/07/presenting-wrist-presenter-for-android-and-the-pebble-smartwatch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/03/07/presenting-wrist-presenter-for-android-and-the-pebble-smartwatch/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://andydyer.org/images/wristpresenter_icon@2x.png" alt="Wrist Presenter" style="width: 150px; float: left; margin-right: 20px" />
Shortly after getting a Pebble Smartwatch this past Christmas, my coworker and all-around-cool-dude [Matthew Morey](http://matthewmorey.com/) asked me if I'd be interested in developing the Android version of his [Wrist Presenter iOS app](http://matthewmorey.com/wrist-presenter/). Luckily, he already had a rock solid Pebble app developed, so I didn't have to flex my meager C programming skills.
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://wristpresenter.com/">Wrist Presenter&lt;/a> turns your Pebble Smartwatch into a remote for presentations running on your Android or iOS device.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TechStreet Houston: Intro to Android Programming</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/11/20/techstreet-houston-intro-to-android-programming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/11/20/techstreet-houston-intro-to-android-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m giving another Intro to Android Programming talk at &lt;a href="http://www.techstreethouston.com/">TechStreet Houston&lt;/a> today. The slides are very similar to my previous talk at Houston TechFest, but &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r6jf2VPOETDOR7TcFGw_qPymbYOEfmaDGC5v2Hib31o/edit?usp=sharing">here is the link&lt;/a> for today&amp;rsquo;s presentation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things I Learned at Big Android BBQ 2013</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/10/13/things-i-learned-at-big-android-bbq-2013/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/10/13/things-i-learned-at-big-android-bbq-2013/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>T-Mobile reception is still terrible at the conference center.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alcohol purchases spike in the City of Hurst as a result of the conference.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The guys from &lt;a href="http://www.willowtreeapps.com/">Willow Tree Apps&lt;/a> have released some awesome Android open source libraries (&lt;a href="https://github.com/derekbrameyer/android-betterpickers">BetterPickers&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/willowtreeapps/OAK">OAK&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/JonathanNye/rpatch">RPatch&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s worth the short drive to &lt;a href="http://rootscoffeehouse.com/north-richland-hills/">Roots Coffee&lt;/a> each morning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.highrollerusa.com/shop/">High Roller&lt;/a> makes adult size big wheels. They are a ton of fun to ride.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://en.oppo.com/">Oppo&lt;/a> makes some pretty sweet phones. Their &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/23/4762618/oppo-n1-announced-cyanogenmod-android-rotating-camera">N1 will ship with&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I wish I had signed up for the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/">Google Glass Explorer&lt;/a> program.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/112937922652870132700">Daniel Ward&lt;/a> bears a &lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-y68HoUyN5-Y/Uln1HvB7fRI/AAAAAAAARcw/D--lqBnDrJg/w852-h474/daniel-obiwan.jpg">strong resemblance&lt;/a> to Ewan McGregor&amp;rsquo;s Obi Wan Kenobi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google makes Android. Anyone who attended the closing keynote/panel will understand why this is funny.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/111558319297322546031">Ray Walters&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> BBQ: OMG. So good!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Agile is dead. Liquid will soon be the new hotness. More on this later.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I thoroughly enjoyed the conference once again this year. I highly recommend it to anyone who has anything to do with Android.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big Android BBQ 2013 - Android Open Source Libraries You Need in Your Life</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/10/11/big-android-bbq-2013-android-open-source-libraries-you-need-in-your-life/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/10/11/big-android-bbq-2013-android-open-source-libraries-you-need-in-your-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my second year to speak at the &lt;a href="http://www.bigandroidbbq.com/">Big Android BBQ&lt;/a> in Hurst, TX.
