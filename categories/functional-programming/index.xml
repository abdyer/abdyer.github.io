	It's been over a year since I've posted here, but I've been busy delving into Android and Ruby on Rails among other
	things. To get back into blogging (hopefully more regularly...we'll see), I thought I'd share an interesting
	JavaScript exercise I was asked to complete as part of a job interview recently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The task was to build a functional queue in JavaScript.  A functional queue is a queue (first in, first out) which
	is implemented with no side-effects.  For instance, a function to enqueue a value onto an existing queue will return
	a new object which represents the larger queue.  The original (smaller) queue is still available.
