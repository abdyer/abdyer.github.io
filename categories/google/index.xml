We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there, sneaking around interviewing for a new job like we&amp;rsquo;re having an affair. Only this time, it was different. As an Android developer, this was like trying out for the majors. No&amp;hellip;seriously, y&amp;rsquo;all&amp;hellip;Google invited me to interview.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My adventure started early last month as I was triaging my inbox. There were the usual spammy recruiter emails seeking &amp;ldquo;rock stars&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ninjas&amp;rdquo; with skills in technologies I abandoned years ago. I skimmed what appeared to be another of these and stopped when I read &amp;ldquo;mobile is a huge priority for us here at Google&amp;rdquo;. Did I read that correctly? Apparently I did. Where did this come from? The domain was google.com. &lt;a href="http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/54979149.jpg">For real tho&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
