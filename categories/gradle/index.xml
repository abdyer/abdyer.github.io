My solution for running the delombok task used Ant and was based on what I found after the requisite Google &amp;amp; StackOverflow searching. This worked just fine until Android Studio 1.0 and the associated Gradle build tools were released at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crux of the problem appeared to be a change in the way dependencies are merged during compilation. Countless &amp;ldquo;package does not exist errors&amp;rdquo; were causing the delombok task to fail. I first attempted to solve this by changing the way the classpath was built in the task. While I was able to reduce the number of errors, I didn&amp;rsquo;t succeed in completely fixing the problem. All the while, running the delombok task directly from the command line with &lt;code&gt;java -jar build-libs/lombok.jar delombok src -d build/src-delomboked&lt;/code&gt; ran successfully.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hosting Android Dependencies on GitHub</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/10/05/hosting-android-dependencies-on-github/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/10/05/hosting-android-dependencies-on-github/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href="http://andydyer.org/blog/2014/09/29/delombok-and-javadoc-with-gradle/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m developing an SDK at work. The libraries I use most frequently in my apps are all included as Maven dependencies. Adding a line to my &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; file is much preferred to downloading a JAR file. To make the SDK as easy as possible for developers to include in their projects, I wanted to deliver it the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://central.sonatype.org/"&gt;Maven Central&lt;/a&gt; is the de facto repository for open source library hosting. Since the SDK I&amp;rsquo;m developing is part of a product and as such will not be open source, I needed to find another place to host the binary that would still allow it to be included via Maven.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Delombok and Javadoc with Gradle</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/09/29/delombok-and-javadoc-with-gradle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/09/29/delombok-and-javadoc-with-gradle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had my first experience working with Javadoc to generate documentation for an SDK I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing at work. In general, I&amp;rsquo;m in the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/"&gt;clean code doesn&amp;rsquo;t need comments&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; camp, but SDKs tend to be a limited view into a larger abstraction, so good documentation is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javadoc has been around since the introduction of the Java language, so I won&amp;rsquo;t include a primer here. If you want to learn more, &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/javadoc-137458.html"&gt;Oracle has you covered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
