 I hightailed it out of Houston last Wednesday when it was pretty clear Ike was gonna slap us around.  Unlike most of
 those trying to evacuate, I eschewed the ever popular I-10 and I-45 routes for Highway 6.  I followed that up
 through Waco and then hit I-35 up to my parents' in Oklahoma City.  Along the way, I enjoyed another non-Dominican
 cigar and cranked the tunes.&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>Since I've been in OKC, I've made the most of it.  Power was out in our office, so I didn't do any work until
 Tuesday.  I hit &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/guestroomrecords">Guest Room Records&lt;/a> on the north side of
 town where I picked up the Black Kids' "&lt;a

 Traumatic&lt;/a>", Hot Hot Heat's "&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Up-Breakdown-Hot-Heat/dp/B00006L3PY/ref=pd_bbs_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1221788588&amp;amp;sr=8-3">Make
 Up the Breakdown&lt;/a>", Ryan Adams' "&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Follow-Lights-Ryan-Adams-Cardinals/dp/B000VZC4DK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1221789870&amp;amp;sr=1-1">Follow
 the Lights&lt;/a>" EP, The Cure's "&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Staring-At-Sea-Singles-Cure/dp/B00002615M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1221789896&amp;amp;sr=1-2">Staring
 at the Sea&lt;/a>", and Pink Floyd's "&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Wall-Pink-Floyd/dp/B0000025H6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1221789932&amp;amp;sr=1-3">The
 Wall&lt;/a>" on vinyl.  While I love my Cactus, Guest Room is a helluva store.  They also have a store in
 Norman, home of my alma mater, &lt;a href="http://www.ou.edu/web/home.html">OU&lt;/a> (Boomer Sooner!), which I plan
 to visit on my way out of town.&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>I've done a lot hanging out with friends.  We went to &lt;a
 href="http://oklahomacity.citysearch.com/profile/33547844/oklahoma_city_ok/electro_lounge.html">Electro
 Lounge&lt;/a> one night and I was thoroughly impressed.  Great beer selection (&lt;a
 href="http://www.sierranevada.com/">Sierra Nevada&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/">Stone&lt;/a>, &lt;a
 href="http://www.unibroue.com/english.cfm">Unibroue&lt;/a>, etc.) and an amazing jukebox (&lt;a
 href="http://www.myspace.com/tokyopoliceclub">Tokyo Police Club&lt;/a>, &lt;a
 href="http://www.myspace.com/silversunpickups">Silversun Pickups&lt;/a>, &lt;a
 href="http://www.myspace.com/peterbjornandjohn">Peter Bjorn and John&lt;/a>, &lt;a
 href="http://www.myspace.com/pixies">The Pixies&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/flaminglips">Flaming
 Lips&lt;/a>, and on and on).  My kind of place!  We hit &lt;a href="http://www.makersokc.com/">Maker's&lt;/a> in &lt;a
 href="http://www.bricktownokc.com/">Bricktown&lt;/a> another night for cigars and cocktails.  I saw the &lt;a
 href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/40060-its-official-flaming-lips-alley-oklahoma-city">Flaming
 Lips Alley&lt;/a> street sign for the first time there but unfortunately I wasn't able to get a good picture of
 it with my phone.&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>Last night, we watched some friends' band play happy hour at &lt;a
 href="http://www.mickeymantlesteakhouse.com/">Mickey Mantle's&lt;/a> downtown.  After that, we ended up at &lt;a
 href="http://www.buffalowildwings.com/">Buffalo Wild Wings&lt;/a> for karaoke.  It's been quite awhile since I
 did it, but I rose above the mediocrity of many of my fellow karaokers (okay, so that may not really be a word)
 to deliver an animated performance of John Michael Montgomery's "Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)".
  &lt;br />&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>I'm so ready to head back to H-Town, but dreading the stench in my fridge.  I still have no power, but luckily
 Jamie snagged us a place where we can stay for a couple weeks if necessary.  &lt;a
 href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Houston-lyrics-/DAA194A3BE41F9EA48256E1D001543AA">As Bobby Bare
 said&lt;/a>, I'm "going back to Houston Houston Houston".&lt;/div>
