Luckily I had the foresight to keep a running list in Evernote throughout the year, so the tough part was putting them in order. Some may argue about the order of the albums on the list or the exclusion of others. I'd love to hear your opinions.
So without any further jibba jabba, here's my Top 10 Albums of 2010 list: Local Natives - Gorilla Manor The harmonies are amazing.</description></item><item><title>Bands I've Seen Live</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2009/04/19/bands-ive-seen-live/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2009 09:12:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2009/04/19/bands-ive-seen-live/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for quite some time about trying to compile a list of all the bands I&amp;rsquo;ve seen live over the years. I&amp;rsquo;ll put these in order as much as possible. I plan to keep adding to this as I recall past shows and attend more in the future. I have a ticket stub book, so I&amp;rsquo;ll include the dates and other details for those I have. Some of these are special in that the bands have since split up, are no longer touring, and/or some members have passed away.</description></item></channel></rss>
