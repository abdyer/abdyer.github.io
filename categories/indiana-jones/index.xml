 alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5207302434214956498" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it's been over a week yet again
 since my last post. If I actually had some readers, this would be a bad thing. But since I don't, I guess it doesn't
 really matter much. If anyone does read this drivel, please leave a comment so I can feel good about myself.
 Actually, I don't need anyone to make me feel good about myself, but it would be nice to know you're reading
 this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like hundreds of other people yesterday ventured out to Bayou Park for the grand opening of the
 &lt;a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/parks/lee-joepark.html"&gt;Lee and Joe Jamail Skate Park&lt;/a&gt;. For those of you who
 haven't been following its construction, this is a FREE public skate park just outside of downtown. I dabbled in
 skateboarding back in 6th &amp;amp; 7th grade and still hop on my board from time to time to ride back and forth like
 I'm cool. I really feel like the old guy at the skate park, but the kids don't seem to mind and I try to stay out of
 their way. I didn't skate yesterday, and instead joined the crowd around the side of the "expert" bowl. We were
 treated to demos by some of the top pro skaters, most of whom I didn't recognize since I followed the sport much
 more closely "back in the day". But none other than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White"&gt;Shaun White
 (Olympic gold medal snowboarder, aka The Flying Tomato)&lt;/a&gt; was there only on a skateboard. I felt very
 privileged to see him in action. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, Jamie and I saw the Old 97's at Meridian on
 Friday. They played a bunch of songs from their new album. There was even a wedding proposal on stage during the
 sugary sweet "Question". I'm liking their new album more and more each time I listen to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also saw
 the new &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/"&gt;Indiana Jones movie&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend. It fit nicely with
 the others and seemed to prepare Shia LaBeouf to take on the role of Indy in the next movie. I guess we'll see. My
 only beef with the movie was the odd ending, but it is George Lucas, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally managed to try
 some of &lt;a href="http://www.southernstarbrewery.com/"&gt;Southern Star Brewing'&lt;/a&gt;s beer at &lt;a
 href="http://www.beerknurd.com/"&gt;The Flying Saucer&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend. Southern Star is a new brewery up near
 Conroe that was started by a guy I know from my homebrew club and one of his friends. I tried their &lt;a
 href="http://www.southernstarbrewery.com/SSBBeers.asp"&gt;Pine Belt Pale Ale&lt;/a&gt; and really liked it. Hop nectar,
 for sure. Good luck, guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to work...&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
