&lt;p>As promised in &lt;a href="https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/03/21/building-a-family-tree-dsl-with-jetpack-compose-syntax/">my last post&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s time to use our family tree DSL to spoil the plot of &lt;a href="https://dark.netflix.io">Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Dark series&lt;/a>! ðŸ˜ˆ&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To quickly recap, we have a small but functional (my puns are always intended) DSL for building a family tree in Kotlin:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The family trees are of course the focus of the series as they are revealed to us piecemeal; episode by episode, season by season. After watching it, I was overwhelmed with all the details and quickly gave up trying to fit it all together. Sure, I remembered some of the bigger points, but it makes a lot more sense after stepping through the &lt;a href="https://dark.netflix.io">Dark website&lt;/a> to build the family trees below:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Family Tree DSL with Jetpack ComposeÂ syntax</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/03/21/building-a-family-tree-dsl-with-jetpack-compose-syntax/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 20:05:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/03/21/building-a-family-tree-dsl-with-jetpack-compose-syntax/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;h3 id="why-build-a-dsl">Why build a DSL?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ever since first getting into Kotlin, I&amp;rsquo;ve known it has a few things that makes building domain-specific languages (DSLs) easier. I&amp;rsquo;ve read the mind-expanding &lt;a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html">type-safe builders&lt;/a> guide for building a DSL for HTML, but until recently I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found a good use case for building a DSL of my own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://jobs.zalando.com/en/jobs/2986308-senior-android-engineer-appcraft-mobile">My team at Zalando&lt;/a> maintains server-driven UI libraries for Android &amp;amp; iOS that power completely dynamic screens such as home, brand homes, collections, and various landing pages in the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.zalando.mobile">Zalando fashion&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/zalando-fashion-shopping/id585629514?l=en">store apps&lt;/a>. Often, we need to build mock responses during development for new features that don&amp;rsquo;t have a backend implementation yet or models for unit tests. In the past, we&amp;rsquo;d grab chunks of JSON from API responses and edit them, but navigating a wall of text is tedious and editing JSON is far less fun than writing code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flexbox Layout Behavior in Jetpack Compose</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/03/16/flexbox-layout-behavior-in-jetpack-compose/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 10:31:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/03/16/flexbox-layout-behavior-in-jetpack-compose/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/">CSS Flexible Box Layout specification&lt;/a> (AKA flexbox) is a useful abstraction for describing layouts in a platform agnostic way. For this reason, it is widely used on the web and even &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout">on mobile&lt;/a>. Readers familiar with &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout">&lt;code>ConstraintLayout&lt;/code>&lt;/a> can think of flexbox as conceptually similar to the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/helper/widget/Flow">&lt;code>Flow&lt;/code>&lt;/a> virtual layout it supports. This type of layout is ideal for grids or other groups of views with varying sizes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
