Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned:
It is possible to survive a summer without air conditioning. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to go all summer without a mosquito bite. I don&amp;rsquo;t miss having a car. Public transit is great here so I typically only need one to haul things like furniture. And I can rent one on demand pretty easily with apps like DriveNow.</description></item><item><title>Aufwiedersehen, Houston! Hallo, Berlin!</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2017/02/02/aufwiedersehen-houston-hallo-berlin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2017 13:06:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2017/02/02/aufwiedersehen-houston-hallo-berlin/</guid><description>Anyone who has talked to me for more than 10 minutes has probably heard me mention my love for Berlin. I first visited the city about six years ago and almost immediately resolved to make it my home one day. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to finally announce that it&amp;rsquo;s happening! I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining Zalando in Berlin next month to do Android and hopefully step up my fashion game a bit. Radical Agility sounds like engineering nirvana to me!</description></item><item><title>Surprised this domain was available</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/07/14/surprised-this-domain-was-available/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/07/14/surprised-this-domain-was-available/</guid><description>I finally got around to registering a domain name and setting up a basic Octopress site. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting here about music/code/coffee/beer/life releated stuff when the mood strikes.</description></item></channel></rss>
