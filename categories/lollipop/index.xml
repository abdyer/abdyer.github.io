Armed with my Nexus One, Eclipse, and a copy of Apress&amp;rsquo; Pro Android, I spent my nights and weekends learning the inner workings of my now-favorite mobile OS.
Over the years, Music Library has been a playground of sorts for exploring various open source libraries, patterns, and best practices. While there is still a fair amount of code I would write differently today (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, ContentProvider), the app has been and continues to be an enjoyable side project.</description></item></channel></rss>
