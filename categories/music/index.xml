Despite the lack of posts, I still keep a list every year and decided it&amp;rsquo;s time once again to highlight some of the albums I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed most:
Oh Sees - Face Stabber Any year that includes an Oh Sees release will find it in my top albums list, so here it is.</description></item><item><title>Top 10 Albums of 2015</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2016/01/02/top-10-albums-of-2015/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 14:38:02 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2016/01/02/top-10-albums-of-2015/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late with my annual Top 10 list, but here it is roughly ranked by Google Music play count:
Earl Sweatshirt - I Don&amp;rsquo;t Like Shit, I Don&amp;rsquo;t Go Outside I was finally lucky enough to see him live and he didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint. Another great release. This soundtracked numerous skateboard and chill sessions. Vince Staples - Summertime &amp;lsquo;06 His &amp;ldquo;Hell Can Wait&amp;rdquo; EP made my list last year and I knew this one would be on this year&amp;rsquo;s list right away.</description></item><item><title>Top 10 Albums of 2014</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/12/26/top-10-albums-of-2014/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/12/26/top-10-albums-of-2014/</guid><description>The end of another year means it&amp;rsquo;s time for the annual Top 10 Favorite Albums list.
Ty Segall - Manipulator While not the leader in sheer track plays via my Google Play Music account, this album is perfect all the way through. It certainly spent a lot of time on my turntable as well. Nothing - Guilty of Everything A wonderful example of the specific brand of rock music I love.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Kollektor</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/12/28/introducing-kollektor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/12/28/introducing-kollektor/</guid><description>Why a new app? When I first decided to get into Android development, I created the Music Library app to catalog my vinyl collection. It served me well as I learned the ins and outs of Android programming including content providers, interacting with other applications via intents, working with the file system to save/load images, making API requests, etc. In order to test the workings of the Android app market, I published the ad supported Music Library Free and the paid Music Library versions of the app.</description></item><item><title>Top 10 Albums of 2013</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/12/22/top-10-albums-of-2013/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2013/12/22/top-10-albums-of-2013/</guid><description>Each year, I keep a list of albums that I find myself listening to frequently. This is the time of year when I review the list and pick my top 10. I ventured into hip-hop and electronic music a bit more this year. Psych rock and 90s style fuzz are also well represented.
My Bloody Valentine - MBV Disclosure - Settle Swearin&amp;rsquo; - Dust in the Gold Sack Weed - Deserve Thee Oh Sees - Floating Coffin Night Beats - Sonic Bloom Speedy Ortiz - Major Arcana Unknown Mortal Orchestra - II Waxahatchee - Cerulean Salt Earl Sweatshirt - Doris</description></item><item><title>My Top 10 Albums of 2010</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/12/28/my-top-10-albums-of-2010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/12/28/my-top-10-albums-of-2010/</guid><description>Since I put together my inaugural Top 10 list last year, I may as well make it a tradition. Luckily I had the foresight to keep a running list in Evernote throughout the year, so the tough part was putting them in order. Some may argue about the order of the albums on the list or the exclusion of others. I'd love to hear your opinions.
So without any further jibba jabba, here's my Top 10 Albums of 2010 list: Local Natives - Gorilla Manor The harmonies are amazing.</description></item><item><title>Indie Rock Mix CD for My Canada/Montreal Trip</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/07/07/indie-rock-mix-cd-for-my-canada/montreal-trip/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/07/07/indie-rock-mix-cd-for-my-canada/montreal-trip/</guid><description>Any good trip needs a soundtrack. With this in mind, I created a mix CD with the following tracks. All of the bands except where noted hail from Montreal or at least Canada. I've included links to listen to the tracks on YouTube. No Celine Dion or Bryan Adams will be found here, only the coolest indie bands Canada has to offer.
These are in no particular order. I know, I know.</description></item><item><title>Bands I've Seen Live</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2009/04/19/bands-ive-seen-live/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2009 09:12:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2009/04/19/bands-ive-seen-live/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for quite some time about trying to compile a list of all the bands I&amp;rsquo;ve seen live over the years. I&amp;rsquo;ll put these in order as much as possible. I plan to keep adding to this as I recall past shows and attend more in the future. I have a ticket stub book, so I&amp;rsquo;ll include the dates and other details for those I have. Some of these are special in that the bands have since split up, are no longer touring, and/or some members have passed away.</description></item><item><title>My latest adventures</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/11/08/my-latest-adventures/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/11/08/my-latest-adventures/</guid><description>Again, too long between blog posts. My faithful readers are clammoring for more of my adventures. Right? Well, most likely not, but here it goes...
First, Jamie and I went to the ACL Festival in Austin about a month ago. It was the first time to go for both of us and we saw a ton of great bands including Vampire Weekend, Bobby Bare Jr, Mates of State, Jenny Lewis, Old 97's, Jose Gonzalez, Drive-By Truckers, Cansei de ser Sexy (CSS), MGMT, Conor Oberst, and Beck.</description></item></channel></rss>
