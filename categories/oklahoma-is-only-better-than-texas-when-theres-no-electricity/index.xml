      <description>I hightailed it out of Houston last Wednesday when it was pretty clear Ike was gonna slap us around. Unlike most of those trying to evacuate, I eschewed the ever popular I-10 and I-45 routes for Highway 6. I followed that up through Waco and then hit I-35 up to my parents&#39; in Oklahoma City. Along the way, I enjoyed another non-Dominican cigar and cranked the tunes.
 Since I&#39;ve been in OKC, I&#39;ve made the most of it.</description>
