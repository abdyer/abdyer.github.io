      <description>Yes, it&#39;s been over a week yet again since my last post. If I actually had some readers, this would be a bad thing. But since I don&#39;t, I guess it doesn&#39;t really matter much. If anyone does read this drivel, please leave a comment so I can feel good about myself. Actually, I don&#39;t need anyone to make me feel good about myself, but it would be nice to know you&#39;re reading this.</description>
