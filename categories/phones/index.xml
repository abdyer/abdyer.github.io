      <description>I thoroughly enjoyed my last night in Berlin a little over a week ago; so much that I didn&#39;t notice my phone was missing until the end of the night. Shake your head and say it couldn&#39;t happen to you. I thought the same thing until it did. Normally, I keep my phone in one of my front pockets, but I was wearing a coat that covered the pocket, making it a bit more difficult to grab my phone quickly to check Google Maps.</description>
