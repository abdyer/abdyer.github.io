&lt;p>As promised in &lt;a href="https://andydyer.org/blog/2021/03/21/building-a-family-tree-dsl-with-jetpack-compose-syntax/">my last post&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s time to use our family tree DSL to spoil the plot of &lt;a href="https://dark.netflix.io">Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Dark series&lt;/a>! ðŸ˜ˆ&lt;/p>
