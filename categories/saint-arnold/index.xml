 Jamie I saw &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/matesofstate">Mates of State&lt;/a> this past Thursday at &lt;a
 href="http://www.warehouselive.com/">Warehouse Live&lt;/a>. I've really been digging their new album, &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Re-Arrange-Us-Mates-State/dp/B0016MJ2PU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1213562189&amp;amp;sr=8-1">Re-Arrange
 Us&lt;/a> and it was my first time to see them live. For only two people, their unique combination of keyboard,
 drums, and vocal harmony makes for a nice, full sound. I picked their latest up on vinyl, which overflowed my record
 collection into its &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40101276">2nd crate&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here's a
 video I took of "Get Better" and "Think Long":&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;object height="344" width="425">

 width="425">&lt;/embed>&lt;/object>&lt;br />&lt;br />Jamie surprised me with the &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Critic-Houston-Restaurant-Guide/dp/0974014346/">Fearless Critic's guide to
 Houston restaurants&lt;/a> and since I've been wanting some Korean food for awhile now, we checked the reviews and
 decided to try &lt;a
 href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/43106853/houston_tx/bonga_korean_restaurant.html">Bonga&lt;/a> the
 other night. I lived in Korea a couple times as a kid when my dad was stationed there, so I was familiar with a few
 of the dishes. We shared &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi">bulgogi&lt;/a> and &lt;a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi">kimchi&lt;/a>, two of the most well-known. It was great to try something
 new and the review gave us confidence that we wouldn't be disappointed. We weren't. The guide gave it a grade of A-
 and I have to agree. Very tasty stuff at a reasonable price.&lt;br />&lt;br />We met some friends at &lt;a
 href="http://www.onioncreekcafe.com/">Onion Creek&lt;/a> for dinner last night, mainly because I wanted to try &lt;a
 href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/337/43157">Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #6&lt;/a>, a limited release beer
 OC has on draft. This edition is an American &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley_wine">Barleywine&lt;/a> and
 for those of you who aren't beer geeks, think of running to the record store when your favorite band puts out a new
 album. Only replace record store with &lt;a href="http://www.specsonline.com/">Spec's&lt;/a> and album with limited
 edition microbrew. In other words, something to get excited about if you're into such things. The beer weighs in at
 a hefty 10% abv, so a couple pints was all I could endure in one sitting.&lt;br />&lt;br />This morning, I wanted some
 non-&lt;a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">corporate coffee&lt;/a>, so I decided to stop by &lt;a
 href="http://www.b4-u-eat.com/houston/restaurants/reviews/rsv0996.asp">Cafe Artiste&lt;/a> for some. I was very
 disappointed to find the parking lot empty and a "For Lease" sign in the window. That was such a great place! It
 will be missed...&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>French Kicks Show, New Records, and a 10 Mile Run</title><link>https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/06/08/french-kicks-show-new-records-and-a-10-mile-run/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/06/08/french-kicks-show-new-records-and-a-10-mile-run/</guid><description>&lt;div class='post'>

 id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5209751300198263410" border="0" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />Once again, I packed a lot of fun into the
 weekend. Jamie and I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/frenchkicks">French Kicks&lt;/a> concert at &lt;a
 href="http://www.4215washington.com/">Walter's&lt;/a> on Friday night with some friends. Houston's own &lt;a
 href="http://www.myspace.com/youngmammals">Young Mammals&lt;/a> (formerly The Dimes) opened and made me a fan
 almost instantly. It was my second time to see the French Kicks and they put on a great show yet again.&lt;br />&lt;br />I
 took it easy Saturday. I got a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidor">humidor&lt;/a> for some quality cigars I
 recently procured and then paid another visit to my music mecca, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/cactusmv">Cactus
 Records&lt;/a>. There was a DJ spinning classic blues records at Cactus and &lt;a
 href="http://www.saintarnold.com/">Saint Arnold&lt;/a> once again provided free beer. I sipped a beer as I flipped
 through the new records. I had planned to get the &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/spoon">Spoon&lt;/a> records I needed
 to complete my collection (I already had &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Ga/dp/B000RGSOQO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-1">Ga
 Ga Ga Ga Ga&lt;/a> and &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Sneaks-US-Bonus-Tracks/dp/B000067FU3/ref=pd_bbs_9?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-9">Series
 of Sneaks&lt;/a>), but was also excited to find &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/bornruffians">Born Ruffians&lt;/a>'
 latest as well. So my collection now includes:&lt;br />
 &lt;ul>
 &lt;li>&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Can-Tell-Spoon/dp/B000056O2Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-5">Spoon
 - Girls Can Tell&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Kill-Moonlight-Spoon/dp/B000069DOH/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-4">Spoon
 - Kill The Moonlight&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Gimme-Fiction-Spoon/dp/B00082ZRN0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-2">Spoon
 - Gimme Fiction&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a

 Ruffians - Red Yellow &amp;amp; Blue&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;/ul>So other than the hard to find &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Telephono-Soft-Effects-Spoon/dp/B000FUF870/ref=pd_bbs_10?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-10">Telephono
 &amp;amp; Soft Effects&lt;/a>, my Spoon vinyl collection is now complete.&lt;br />&lt;br />I finished the weekend off with a
 10 mile run at Terry Hershey park. It was my first time to run there and the rolling hills were a nice change from
 the flats I usually run. I averaged about 10:30/mile, which is a little slower than I'd like but I took one minute
 walk breaks every eight minutes to avoid wearing myself out. I finished up with 2100 calories burned, which I
 promptly started replacing with a &lt;a href="http://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle&lt;/a> burrito and some &lt;a
 href="http://www.saintarnold.com/beers/amber.html">Saint Arnold Amber&lt;/a>. I'm beat but feeling pretty
 accomplished. Off to bed to now to sleep like a baby...

 with some friends at &lt;a
 href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=pace+bend+park+austin,+tx&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=30.445936,-98.037786&amp;amp;spn=0.040401,0.09407&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=B">Pace
 Bend Park&lt;/a> next to Lake Travis, TX. For the most part, we just hung out enjoying tasty beer (&lt;a
 href="http://www.saintarnold.com/">Saint Arnold&lt;/a>'s Lawnmower/Summer Pilsner/Amber and &lt;a
 href="http://www.sierranevada.com/index2.asp">Sierra Nevada&lt;/a> Pale Ale for you connoisseurs), a fine &lt;a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohiba_%28cigar_brand%29">Cuban cigar&lt;/a>, and the perfect weather. One of
 the highlights of the trip for me was setting a new personal record for downhill speed on our 35 mile bike ride
 around the lake. Before that ride, my max downhill speed was somewhere between 40-45 mph. Yesterday, I topped out at
 51.2 mph (can I get a "Hell yeah!"?) going down the biggest hill of the ride. I was literally shaking at the bottom
 of the hill from the rush. What a thrill! This one downhill made up for all the grueling climbs and the slight
 sunburn from the rest of the ride. I've included a picture of my bike computer as proof.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'd say the only
 downside of the trip was the inconsiderate jackasses who insisted on blaring their music in the wee hours of the
 night both Friday and Saturday. Why do these people always listen to the crappiest music? We heard a mind-numbing
 mix of horrid techno and the most cliched 80's rock ballads at ridiculous volumes. I'd much prefer to go to sleep to
 the sounds of nature.&lt;br />&lt;br />Today on the way out of Austin, we stopped for brunch at &lt;a
 href="http://www.cafemagnolia.com/">Magnolia Cafe&lt;/a>. It was my first time to eat there and it's now another
 place on my growing list of great restaurants to visit when in our state's capital city.&lt;/div></description></item></channel></rss>
