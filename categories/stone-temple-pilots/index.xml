      <description>The Stone Temple Pilots concert this past Saturday ROCKED! See my videos on YouTube for proof, you skeptics. I didn&#39;t see them &#34;back in the day&#34; so it was great to finally get the chance. Only two things could have made it better - new songs (where are they, guys?) and reasonable prices for beer (they were $10 for a 24 oz Shiner). But as I said before, I&#39;m not much of a ranter so I&#39;ll leave it at that.</description>
