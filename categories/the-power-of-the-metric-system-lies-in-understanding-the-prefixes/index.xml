 Today I stopped by my local Sport Clips to get some more shampoo. Yes, even shaved heads need to be washed with
 quality shampoo. Trust me, it's that much more important when people can see every inch of your scalp. I go with the
 &lt;a href="http://www.paulmitchell.com/Products/TeaTree/Care/Pages/TeaTreeSpecialShampoo.aspx"&gt;Paul Mitchell Tea Tree
 stuff&lt;/a&gt;. At first, I liked it for the tingly sensation, but I guess my head is way too cool for that now
 because I don't feel a thing when I use it. But my hair always looks great (ha ha ha, I know) so I continue using
 it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I perused the shampoo selection and various sizes, I noticed a 1L mega size alongside my usual
 500ml size. Since there were no prices on them, I asked the girl behind the counter what the price difference was
 between the two sizes. She told me, and even though the larger size contained twice as much as the other size, the
 price was a little less than double. I said something along those lines more to myself than to her and she said,
 "No, it's three times the shampoo." I was a bit confused by her statement because I learned the metric system in
 elementary school and 1L = 1000ml = 2 x 500ml. I pointed this out and she said, "Hmm, I learn something new every
 day." To downplay my intellectual superiority and to make her feel better for not knowing, I said, "Well, if you
 tell people it's three times as much, maybe you'll sell more." Now I wonder to myself whether she'll do just that or
 try to impress people with her newfound knowledge of the metric system...&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
