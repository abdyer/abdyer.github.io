 weekend. Jamie and I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/frenchkicks">French Kicks&lt;/a> concert at &lt;a
 href="http://www.4215washington.com/">Walter's&lt;/a> on Friday night with some friends. Houston's own &lt;a
 href="http://www.myspace.com/youngmammals">Young Mammals&lt;/a> (formerly The Dimes) opened and made me a fan
 almost instantly. It was my second time to see the French Kicks and they put on a great show yet again.&lt;br />&lt;br />I
 took it easy Saturday. I got a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidor">humidor&lt;/a> for some quality cigars I
 recently procured and then paid another visit to my music mecca, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/cactusmv">Cactus
 Records&lt;/a>. There was a DJ spinning classic blues records at Cactus and &lt;a
 href="http://www.saintarnold.com/">Saint Arnold&lt;/a> once again provided free beer. I sipped a beer as I flipped
 through the new records. I had planned to get the &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/spoon">Spoon&lt;/a> records I needed
 to complete my collection (I already had &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Ga/dp/B000RGSOQO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-1">Ga
 Ga Ga Ga Ga&lt;/a> and &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Sneaks-US-Bonus-Tracks/dp/B000067FU3/ref=pd_bbs_9?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-9">Series
 of Sneaks&lt;/a>), but was also excited to find &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/bornruffians">Born Ruffians&lt;/a>'
 latest as well. So my collection now includes:&lt;br />
 &lt;ul>
 &lt;li>&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Girls-Can-Tell-Spoon/dp/B000056O2Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-5">Spoon
 - Girls Can Tell&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Kill-Moonlight-Spoon/dp/B000069DOH/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-4">Spoon
 - Kill The Moonlight&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Gimme-Fiction-Spoon/dp/B00082ZRN0/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-2">Spoon
 - Gimme Fiction&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Yellow-Blue-Born-Ruffians/dp/B00133KEEU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987675&amp;amp;sr=8-1">Born
 Ruffians - Red Yellow &amp;amp; Blue&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;/ul>So other than the hard to find &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Telephono-Soft-Effects-Spoon/dp/B000FUF870/ref=pd_bbs_10?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1212987503&amp;amp;sr=8-10">Telephono
 &amp;amp; Soft Effects&lt;/a>, my Spoon vinyl collection is now complete.&lt;br />&lt;br />I finished the weekend off with a
 10 mile run at Terry Hershey park. It was my first time to run there and the rolling hills were a nice change from
 the flats I usually run. I averaged about 10:30/mile, which is a little slower than I'd like but I took one minute
 walk breaks every eight minutes to avoid wearing myself out. I finished up with 2100 calories burned, which I
 promptly started replacing with a &lt;a href="http://www.chipotle.com/">Chipotle&lt;/a> burrito and some &lt;a
 href="http://www.saintarnold.com/beers/amber.html">Saint Arnold Amber&lt;/a>. I'm beat but feeling pretty
 accomplished. Off to bed to now to sleep like a baby...
