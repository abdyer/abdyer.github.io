 Jamie I saw &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/matesofstate"&gt;Mates of State&lt;/a&gt; this past Thursday at &lt;a
 href="http://www.warehouselive.com/"&gt;Warehouse Live&lt;/a&gt;. I've really been digging their new album, &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Re-Arrange-Us-Mates-State/dp/B0016MJ2PU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=music&amp;amp;qid=1213562189&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Re-Arrange
 Us&lt;/a&gt; and it was my first time to see them live. For only two people, their unique combination of keyboard,
 drums, and vocal harmony makes for a nice, full sound. I picked their latest up on vinyl, which overflowed my record
 collection into its &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40101276"&gt;2nd crate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a
 video I took of "Get Better" and "Think Long":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;

 width="425"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie surprised me with the &lt;a
 href="http://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Critic-Houston-Restaurant-Guide/dp/0974014346/"&gt;Fearless Critic's guide to
 Houston restaurants&lt;/a&gt; and since I've been wanting some Korean food for awhile now, we checked the reviews and
 decided to try &lt;a
 href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/43106853/houston_tx/bonga_korean_restaurant.html"&gt;Bonga&lt;/a&gt; the
 other night. I lived in Korea a couple times as a kid when my dad was stationed there, so I was familiar with a few
 of the dishes. We shared &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi"&gt;bulgogi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, two of the most well-known. It was great to try something
 new and the review gave us confidence that we wouldn't be disappointed. We weren't. The guide gave it a grade of A-
 and I have to agree. Very tasty stuff at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met some friends at &lt;a
 href="http://www.onioncreekcafe.com/"&gt;Onion Creek&lt;/a&gt; for dinner last night, mainly because I wanted to try &lt;a
 href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/337/43157"&gt;Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #6&lt;/a&gt;, a limited release beer
 OC has on draft. This edition is an American &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley_wine"&gt;Barleywine&lt;/a&gt; and
 for those of you who aren't beer geeks, think of running to the record store when your favorite band puts out a new
 album. Only replace record store with &lt;a href="http://www.specsonline.com/"&gt;Spec's&lt;/a&gt; and album with limited
 edition microbrew. In other words, something to get excited about if you're into such things. The beer weighs in at
 a hefty 10% abv, so a couple pints was all I could endure in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I wanted some
 non-&lt;a href="http://www.starbucks.com/"&gt;corporate coffee&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to stop by &lt;a
 href="http://www.b4-u-eat.com/houston/restaurants/reviews/rsv0996.asp"&gt;Cafe Artiste&lt;/a&gt; for some. I was very
 disappointed to find the parking lot empty and a "For Lease" sign in the window. That was such a great place! It
 will be missed...&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
