 Here goes my foray into proper blogging. I decided to do this for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;I used to enjoy writing until years of composing corporate email took their toll on my once sharp literary
 wit.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Sometimes I think I live in my head too much. I could probably benefit from attempting to organize my
 thoughts in a coherent manner on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;It seems like a good way to let people know what's going on in my life without running the risk of repeating
 the same story to the same people over and over. Those of you who decide this is worth reading will be
 treated to much more efficient conversation (if efficient conversation is your thing).&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;"Blog" sounds so much cooler than "journal" or "diary".&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;All the cool kids are doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this will do for a first entry. Send me comments, links to your blogs, whatever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
