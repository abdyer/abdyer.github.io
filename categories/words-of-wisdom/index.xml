      <description>As I&#39;m staring down 30 (tomorrow at 7:01 pm Central to be exact) I should probably blog about how awful it is, but now that it&#39;s inevitable, I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that scary. I pretty much act like I&#39;m six as often as I can. I&#39;ve worn one of my favorite t-shirts, a He-Man ringer, for years. I just recently picked up a &#39;Vote Optimus 08&#39; Transformers t-shirt, too.</description>
