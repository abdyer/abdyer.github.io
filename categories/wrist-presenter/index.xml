      <description>I got my LG G Android Wear smart watch earlier this week and dove right into developing for it.
My first project was Deutsch Uhr, a text-based German language watch face inspired by my favorite Pebble watch face. I had fun adding animations for the hour/minute/day changes and learning what makes a Wear app tick (pun intended, I always do). A big thanks to my friend Daniel Ward for help getting started.</description>

      <description>Shortly after getting a Pebble Smartwatch this past Christmas, my coworker and all-around-cool-dude Matthew Morey asked me if I&#39;d be interested in developing the Android version of his Wrist Presenter iOS app. Luckily, he already had a rock solid Pebble app developed, so I didn&#39;t have to flex my meager C programming skills.
Wrist Presenter turns your Pebble Smartwatch into a remote for presentations running on your Android or iOS device.</description>
