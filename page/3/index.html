</span><span><p>I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href=https://www.firebase.com/>Firebase</a> lately in preparation for adding data synchronization to my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dandydev.medialibrary">Music Library</a> app. Their <a href=https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/quickstart.html>docs</a> did a great job of getting me set up. Using the <a href=https://github.com/firebase/firebase-login-demo-android>sample app</a> as a guide, I even got Google+ OAuth working without much trouble. From there, it didn&rsquo;t take long to load data into a Firebase instance partitioned by Google account. All that was left was to query the data out of Firebase and I&rsquo;d be able to see the sync magic in action.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/04/06/loading-a-list-of-objects-from-firebase/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/02/19/why-im-unironically-carrying-this-small-older-android-phone/>Why I'm Unironically Carrying This Small, Older Android Phone</a>
</span><span class=item__date>Feb 19, 2015
</span><span><p>I thoroughly enjoyed my last night in Berlin a little over a week ago; so much that I didn&rsquo;t notice my phone was missing until the end of the night. Shake your head and say it couldn&rsquo;t happen to you. I thought the same thing until it did. Normally, I keep my phone in one of my front pockets, but I was wearing a coat that covered the pocket, making it a bit more difficult to grab my phone quickly to check Google Maps. Since my coat has a side access pocket in the chest, I stowed my phone there while walking around. I&rsquo;m guessing a skillful thief at the last bar spotted my phone in that side pocket and was able to slide it out without me knowing. I was in a crowded room and often looking to one side as I talked to different people. Self-shaming thoughts aside, sometimes it happens.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/02/19/why-im-unironically-carrying-this-small-older-android-phone/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/02/08/mce-conference-2015-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications/>MCE Conference 2015 - Automated Testing for Modern Android Applications</a>

I attended talks about Groovy, Kotlin, Proguard, design, scaling apps for emerging markets, and some handy new libraries.</p><p>That alone easily makes MCE one of the best conferences I&rsquo;ve been to.

</span><span class=item__date>Jan 22, 2015
</span><span><p>A few months ago, I <a href=http://andydyer.org/blog/2014/09/29/delombok-and-javadoc-with-gradle/>posted</a> about how to use Gradle tasks to &ldquo;<a href=http://projectlombok.org/features/delombok.html>delombok</a>&rdquo; code using Lombok annotations before generating Javadocs. My solution for running the delombok task used Ant and was based on what I found after the requisite Google & StackOverflow searching. This worked just fine until Android Studio 1.0 and the associated Gradle build tools were released at the end of the year.</p><p>The crux of the problem appeared to be a change in the way dependencies are merged during compilation. Countless &ldquo;package does not exist errors&rdquo; were causing the delombok task to fail. I first attempted to solve this by changing the way the classpath was built in the task. While I was able to reduce the number of errors, I didn&rsquo;t succeed in completely fixing the problem. All the while, running the delombok task directly from the command line with <code>java -jar build-libs/lombok.jar delombok src -d build/src-delomboked</code> ran successfully.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2015/01/22/running-shell-commands-with-gradle-and-a-better-way-to-delombok/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/12/26/top-10-albums-of-2014/>Top 10 Albums of 2014</a>
</span><span class=item__date>Dec 26, 2014
</span><span><p>The end of another year means it&rsquo;s time for the annual Top 10 Favorite Albums list.</p><ol><li><strong>Ty Segall - Manipulator</strong> While not the leader in sheer track plays via my Google Play Music account, this album is perfect all the way through. It certainly spent a lot of time on my turntable as well.</li><li><strong>Nothing - Guilty of Everything</strong> A wonderful example of the specific brand of rock music I love. Heavily <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxXn60Z0yk">MBV</a> influenced wall of sound guitars. They were almost deafeningly loud when I saw them at <a href=http://fitzlivemusic.com>Fitzgerald&rsquo;s</a> over the summer.</li><li><strong>Whirr - Sway</strong> One of the members of Nothing also founded Whirr. As you might expect, they have a similar sound. Similarly awesome.</li><li><strong>Sturgill Simpson - Metamodern Sounds in Country Music</strong> Like a modern day <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14ZHn_76QM0">Waylon Jennings</a>. While I&rsquo;m not a big country fan, I can appreciate honest, heartfelt songs. These are.</li><li><strong>Spoon - They Want My Soul</strong> Such a consistent band. Their sound evolves slightly with each album, yet they always sound like Spoon.</li><li><strong>Meatbodies - Meatbodies</strong> Ty Segall&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDEmMyowfPU">Fuzz</a> band mate Chad Ubovich also helms Meatbodies. Psych rock, fuzz, reverb, etc. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuYOMvTLoJo">Thee Oh Sees</a>/Ty Segall type rock n&rsquo; roll.</li><li><strong>Parquet Courts - Sunbathing Animal</strong> Their slacker rock sound reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPvhKV3Yg2k">Pavement</a>. Simple yet catchy songs.</li><li><strong>Cheatahs - Cheatahs</strong> On par with the Nothing and Whirr albums on the list, more fuzzy droning shoegaze-y goodness.</li><li><strong>Schoolboy Q - Oxymoron</strong> I continued exploring hip-hop this year and this album led the pack. &ldquo;Los Awesome&rdquo; is like a modern day &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWbXQQG9B6c">California Love</a>&rdquo;. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L2vJEb6lVE">Collard Greens</a>&rdquo; features Kendrick Lamar and name checks Houston. And more. What else do you need?</li><li><strong>Vince Staples - Hell Can Wait</strong> Vince Staples has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGfE-mbdmXg">collaborated with Earl Sweatshirt</a> (whose &ldquo;Doris&rdquo; album was on my list last year) and toured this year with Schoolboy Q. Apparently my ear is also finely tuned for a specific style of hip-hop. Whatever the case, this album will get your head nodding if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing.</li></ol><p>I made a YouTube playlist with one of my favorite songs from each album.

I started developing [Music Library](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dandydev.medialibrary) about four years ago when I wanted an app for organizing my record collection. Armed with my Nexus One, Eclipse, and a copy of Apress' [Pro Android](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430246804/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1430246804&linkCode=as2&tag=slacod-20&linkId=FMLK73AOGDPPJEM3), I spent my nights and weekends learning the inner workings of my now-favorite mobile OS.<p>Over the years, Music Library has been a playground of sorts for exploring various open source libraries, patterns, and best practices. While there is still a fair amount of code I would write differently today (I&rsquo;m looking at you, ContentProvider), the app has been and continues to be an enjoyable side project.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/11/02/music-library-3.0-material-design-update/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/10/17/babbq5-automated-testing-for-modern-android-applications/>BABBQ5 - Automated Testing for Modern Android Applications</a>

</span><span><p>As I mentioned in my <a href=http://andydyer.org/blog/2014/09/29/delombok-and-javadoc-with-gradle/>last post</a>, I&rsquo;m developing an SDK at work. The libraries I use most frequently in my apps are all included as Maven dependencies. Adding a line to my <code>build.gradle</code> file is much preferred to downloading a JAR file. To make the SDK as easy as possible for developers to include in their projects, I wanted to deliver it the same way.</p><p><a href=http://central.sonatype.org/>Maven Central</a> is the de facto repository for open source library hosting. Since the SDK I&rsquo;m developing is part of a product and as such will not be open source, I needed to find another place to host the binary that would still allow it to be included via Maven.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/10/05/hosting-android-dependencies-on-github/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2014/09/29/delombok-and-javadoc-with-gradle/>Delombok and Javadoc with Gradle</a>

In general, I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;<a href=http://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/>clean code doesn&rsquo;t need comments</a>&rdquo; camp, but SDKs tend to be a limited view into a larger abstraction, so good documentation is a necessity.</p><p>Javadoc has been around since the introduction of the Java language, so I won&rsquo;t include a primer here.

</span><span><p>Since Android Gingerbread (v2.3), loyalists know that each version has an Easter egg that can be accessed by repeatedly tapping the version number on the Settings > About screen. The Android &ldquo;L&rdquo; Preview is no exception.</p><p>While test driving the new version, I naturally had to see what Google had hidden for me in their latest release. Previous versions have had everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeAFCIvqNxc">gingerbread zombies</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfY73GBBHxg">Nyandroids</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN-nJdAJS7g">pile of jelly beans</a>. The Android &ldquo;L&rdquo; Preview build has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_He5MIYJas8">simple animation of random overlapping red and blue rectangles</a>.
