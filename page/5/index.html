        Since my friend Greg asked for it, here's a review of The Flaming Lips' "New Year's Eve Freakout" as their latest album, "Embryonic", spins on the turntable.
The last time I saw the Lips was in high school just after the release of "Clouds Taste Metallic". That experience and word-of-mouth since prepared me for the celebratory chaos that is a Flaming Lips show. Joe Mathlete of 29-95.com did a very entertaining set of cartoons documenting his trip to OKC for the show accurately described a Flaming Lips concert as "

        I've been thinking for quite some time about trying to compile a list of all the bands I've seen live over the years. I'll put these in order as much as possible. I plan to keep adding to this as I recall past shows and attend more in the future. I have a ticket stub book, so I'll include the dates and other details for those I have. Some of these are special in that the bands have since split up, are no longer touring, and/or some members have passed away.

        The "Quote of the Day" on my Google homepage must repeat every year, because I'm sure I've seen this one before. Nevertheless, it's so true: Happiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular. But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness.

        Again, too long between blog posts. My faithful readers are clammoring for more of my adventures. Right? Well, most likely not, but here it goes...
 First, Jamie and I went to the ACL Festival in Austin about a month ago. It was the first time to go for both of us and we saw a ton of great bands including Vampire Weekend, Bobby Bare Jr, Mates of State, Jenny Lewis, Old 97's, Jose Gonzalez, Drive-By Truckers, Cansei de ser Sexy (CSS), MGMT, Conor Oberst, and Beck.

        I hightailed it out of Houston last Wednesday when it was pretty clear Ike was gonna slap us around. Unlike most of those trying to evacuate, I eschewed the ever popular I-10 and I-45 routes for Highway 6. I followed that up through Waco and then hit I-35 up to my parents' in Oklahoma City. Along the way, I enjoyed another non-Dominican cigar and cranked the tunes.
 Since I've been in OKC, I've made the most of it.

        I haven't blogged for about three weeks! While I have the occasional reader, I don't think anyone's had to deal with a huge hole in their lives as a result of my absence. I could blame it on the heat or the fact that we're now more than halfway through the year and I've taken a total of one day of vacation so far. But I guess I don't have any real reason other than I just didn't feel like it.

        The Stone Temple Pilots concert this past Saturday ROCKED! See my videos on YouTube for proof, you skeptics. I didn't see them "back in the day" so it was great to finally get the chance. Only two things could have made it better - new songs (where are they, guys?) and reasonable prices for beer (they were $10 for a 24 oz Shiner). But as I said before, I'm not much of a ranter so I'll leave it at that.

        I just got an email from Sound Stage Direct, one of my favorite online record stores, which said the vinyl LP record is 60 years old today (invented June 21, 1948 by Peter Goldmark). I searched good ol' YouTube and found the video below which does a good job of providing some history about the format as well as some insight into how exactly records are made. Very interesting...

        Jamie I saw Mates of State this past Thursday at Warehouse Live. I've really been digging their new album, Re-Arrange Us and it was my first time to see them live. For only two people, their unique combination of keyboard, drums, and vocal harmony makes for a nice, full sound. I picked their latest up on vinyl, which overflowed my record collection into its 2nd crate.
Here's a video I took of "

        Once again, I packed a lot of fun into the weekend. Jamie and I went to the French Kicks concert at Walter's on Friday night with some friends. Houston's own Young Mammals (formerly The Dimes) opened and made me a fan almost instantly. It was my second time to see the French Kicks and they put on a great show yet again.
I took it easy Saturday. I got a humidor for some quality cigars I recently procured and then paid another visit to my music mecca, Cactus Records.
