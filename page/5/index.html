<span class=item__date>Feb 03, 2012</span>
<span>It's been over a year since I've posted here, but I've been busy delving into Android and Ruby on Rails among other things. To get back into blogging (hopefully more regularly...we'll see), I thought I'd share an interesting JavaScript exercise I was asked to complete as part of a job interview recently. The task was to build a functional queue in JavaScript. A functional queue is a queue (first in, first out) which is implemented with no side-effects.</span>

<span class=item__date>Dec 28, 2010</span>
<span>Since I put together my inaugural Top 10 list last year, I may as well make it a tradition. Luckily I had the foresight to keep a running list in Evernote throughout the year, so the tough part was putting them in order. Some may argue about the order of the albums on the list or the exclusion of others. I'd love to hear your opinions.
So without any further jibba jabba, here's my Top 10 Albums of 2010 list: Local Natives - Gorilla Manor The harmonies are amazing.</span>

<span class=item__date>Nov 22, 2010</span>
<span>I didn't take much of my vacation time this year, so I'm left with thirteen days of vacation to take in December. In an effort to make the most of this bounty of time off, I made a list of things to do. Thanks to Jamie for suggesting I make a list after patiently enduring my first couple brainstorming sessions.
Here's the list in no particular order:
Triumphant return to homebrewing - Brew an American Pale Ale.</span>

<span class=item__date>Jul 07, 2010</span>
<span>Any good trip needs a soundtrack. With this in mind, I created a mix CD with the following tracks. All of the bands except where noted hail from Montreal or at least Canada. I've included links to listen to the tracks on YouTube. No Celine Dion or Bryan Adams will be found here, only the coolest indie bands Canada has to offer.
These are in no particular order. I know, I know.</span>

<span class=item__date>Jan 02, 2010</span>
<span>Since my friend Greg asked for it, here's a review of The Flaming Lips' "New Year's Eve Freakout" as their latest album, "Embryonic", spins on the turntable.
The last time I saw the Lips was in high school just after the release of "Clouds Taste Metallic". That experience and word-of-mouth since prepared me for the celebratory chaos that is a Flaming Lips show. Joe Mathlete of 29-95.com did a very entertaining set of cartoons documenting his trip to OKC for the show accurately described a Flaming Lips concert as "</span>

<span class=item__date>Apr 19, 2009</span>
<span>I&rsquo;ve been thinking for quite some time about trying to compile a list of all the bands I&rsquo;ve seen live over the years. I&rsquo;ll put these in order as much as possible. I plan to keep adding to this as I recall past shows and attend more in the future. I have a ticket stub book, so I&rsquo;ll include the dates and other details for those I have. Some of these are special in that the bands have since split up, are no longer touring, and/or some members have passed away.</span>

<span class=item__date>Jan 05, 2009</span>
<span>The "Quote of the Day" on my Google homepage must repeat every year, because I'm sure I've seen this one before. Nevertheless, it's so true: Happiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular. But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness.</span>

<span>Again, too long between blog posts. My faithful readers are clammoring for more of my adventures. Right? Well, most likely not, but here it goes...
First, Jamie and I went to the ACL Festival in Austin about a month ago. It was the first time to go for both of us and we saw a ton of great bands including Vampire Weekend, Bobby Bare Jr, Mates of State, Jenny Lewis, Old 97's, Jose Gonzalez, Drive-By Truckers, Cansei de ser Sexy (CSS), MGMT, Conor Oberst, and Beck.</span>

<span>I hightailed it out of Houston last Wednesday when it was pretty clear Ike was gonna slap us around. Unlike most of those trying to evacuate, I eschewed the ever popular I-10 and I-45 routes for Highway 6. I followed that up through Waco and then hit I-35 up to my parents' in Oklahoma City. Along the way, I enjoyed another non-Dominican cigar and cranked the tunes.
Since I've been in OKC, I've made the most of it.</span>

<span>I haven't blogged for about three weeks! While I have the occasional reader, I don't think anyone's had to deal with a huge hole in their lives as a result of my absence. I could blame it on the heat or the fact that we're now more than halfway through the year and I've taken a total of one day of vacation so far. But I guess I don't have any real reason other than I just didn't feel like it.</span>
