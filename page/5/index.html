</span><span><p>When working with the GridView in an Android app recently, I ran into a very strange behavior around setting the
selected state for a view created in my ArrayAdapter's getView() method.  I'm using selectors to handle the drawable
states and everything works properly when tapping a list item to select/tapping again to unselect.  When debugging
the ArrayAdapter's getView() method, I could see that the selected state was being set to the correct value when
calling view.setSelected(), but the button background was not updated to the proper state.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2012/09/25/setting-item-selected-state-in-android-gridview/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2012/02/03/a-functional-queue-in-javascript/>A Functional Queue in JavaScript</a>

things. To get back into blogging (hopefully more regularly...we'll see), I thought I'd share an interesting
JavaScript exercise I was asked to complete as part of a job interview recently.</p><p>The task was to build a functional queue in JavaScript.  A functional queue is a queue (first in, first out) which
is implemented with no side-effects.  For instance, a function to enqueue a value onto an existing queue will return
a new object which represents the larger queue.  The original (smaller) queue is still available.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2012/02/03/a-functional-queue-in-javascript/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/12/28/my-top-10-albums-of-2010/>My Top 10 Albums of 2010</a>
</span><span class=item__date>Dec 28, 2010
</span><span><div class=post>Since I put together my inaugural Top 10 list last year, I may as well make it a tradition. Luckily I had the
foresight to keep a running list in <a href=http://www.evernote.com/>Evernote</a> throughout the year, so the
tough part was putting them in order. Some may argue about the order of the albums on the list or the exclusion of
others. I'd love to hear your opinions.<div><br></div><div>So without any further <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eisa5AZ20W0">jibba jabba</a>, here's my Top 10
Albums of 2010 list:</div><div><ol><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Manor-Local-Natives/dp/B0032IAB4C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593217&amp;sr=8-1">Local
Natives - Gorilla Manor</a></b> The harmonies are amazing. I saw these guys twice this year and
loved both shows.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flaming-Stardeath-Dwarfs-Rollins-Peaches/dp/B003D8O8FY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593246&amp;sr=1-1">Flaming
Lips - Dark Side of the Moon</a> </b>I was lucky enough to see the Lips perform this on <a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/01/02/my-review-of-flaming-lips-new-years-eve/>NYE 2009 in OKC</a>. A great cover
of a great album.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Black-Keys/dp/B003AO1SVS/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593281&amp;sr=1-1">The
Black Keys - Brothers</a></b> I listened to this album over and over this past summer. Nice
gritty bluesy rock.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Blood-Yeasayer/dp/B0030E5NKU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593310&amp;sr=1-1">Yeasayer
- Odd Blood</a></b> Another band I saw live this year. Upbeat indie rock to enliven any task or
workout.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Astro-Coast-Surfer-Blood/dp/B002ZPIBG8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593332&amp;sr=1-1">Surfer
Blood - Astro Coast</a></b> Surf rock sound thanks to lots of Telecaster but new and different
at the same time. Plus a song about <a href=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/>David Lynch</a>.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Say-Born-Ruffians/dp/B003A2HXAK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593352&amp;sr=1-1">Born
Ruffians - Say It</a></b> I saw these guys play at the <a href=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2010/09/i_want_this_place_to.php>newly reopened
Fitzgerald's</a> in my 'hood. Great live show. Catchy album.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transference-Spoon/dp/B002VDZIIS/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593396&amp;sr=1-1">Spoon
- Transference</a></b> Few bands consistently release great albums while gradually morphing
their sound. Spoon does. Another constant listen this past year.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/King-Beach-Wavves/dp/B003SNYZVG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593414&amp;sr=1-1">Wavves
- King of the Beach</a></b> The summer of 2010 was a brief indie surf rock renaissance. Or maybe
I'm discounting a trend with a longer shelf life. But I'm no critic. Good album for the beach. Or kings
of them.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Smile-Suckers/dp/B003HLT0BO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293593441&amp;sr=1-1">Suckers
- Wild Smile</a></b> These guys toured with Local Natives and the first time I heard them was
when they opened that show. Bad ass tunes kinda like Local Natives but not. Apples and oranges, but
still fresh & delicious organic fruit (I may have yuppied that fruit part up a bit, but oh well).</li><li><b><a href=http://giantprincess.blogspot.com/p/merch.html>Giant Princess - Zip Zop Wow</a></b> Awesome
new band from the H Tizzle. Raucous indie rock. Saw them do an in store at my beloved <a href=http://twitter.com/#!/cactus_music>Cactus Music</a> and dug it.</li></ol></div></div></span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/11/22/things-to-do-while-im-on-vacation-in-december/>Things To Do While I'm on Vacation in December</a>
</span><span class=item__date>Nov 22, 2010
</span><span><div class=post>I didn't take much of my vacation time this year, so I'm left with thirteen days of vacation to take in December. In
an effort to make the most of this bounty of time off, I made a list of things to do. Thanks to Jamie for suggesting
I make a list after patiently enduring my first couple brainstorming sessions.<div><br></div><div>Here's the list in no particular order:<br><div><ul><li><b>Triumphant return to homebrewing - </b>Brew an American Pale Ale. Cascade hops and more Cascade
hops.</li><li><b>"Fixing a hole where the rain gets in..." - </b>Patch a couple small leaks in the garage roof.</li><li><b>No clever way to say it - </b>Rake some leaves.</li><li><b>Dining reconnaissance at Stella Sola - </b>One of the few local restaurants I haven't tried yet.</li><li><b>Mini "Into the Wild" camping trip - </b>Solo camping for a few days with my guitar and mountain
bike. Maybe Huntsville State Park.</li><li><b>These are the (An)droids you're looking for - </b>Finally finish developing the Android
application I've been working on sporadically over the past several months.</li><li><b>Save me from my phone, Phone - </b>Build a Windows Phone 7 equivalent of my Android application.
Given the far superior development tools available for WP7, this should be a much quicker build than
the Android app.</li><li><b>Eat, drink, and be merry - </b>Celebrate the most wonderful time of the year with family and
friends.</li><li><b>Put the needle on the record - </b>Put on some headphones, lay on the floor, and enjoy my record
collection.</li><li><b>"Take a look, it's in a book..." - </b>Decide which book I want to read next and spend some time
turning pages.</li></ul></div></div></div></span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2010/07/07/indie-rock-mix-cd-for-my-canada/montreal-trip/>Indie Rock Mix CD for My Canada/Montreal Trip</a>

</span><span class=item__date>Jan 02, 2010
</span><span><div class=post>Since my friend Greg asked for it, here's a review of The Flaming Lips' "New Year's Eve Freakout" as their latest
album, "Embryonic", spins on the turntable.<br><br>The last time I saw the Lips was in high school just after
the release of "Clouds Taste Metallic". That experience and word-of-mouth since prepared me for the celebratory
chaos that is a Flaming Lips show. <a href=http://twitter.com/JoeMathlete>Joe Mathlete</a> of <a href=http://www.29-95.com/>29-95.com</a> did <a href=http://www.29-95.com/time-suck/story/my-flaming-lips-new-year%E2%80%99s-eve-extravaganza-part-one>a very
entertaining set of cartoons</a> documenting his trip to OKC for the show accurately described a Flaming Lips
concert as "the biggest happiest birthday party ever, and everyone in the room is turning six".<br><br>The
biggest draw for me was the fact that the Lips <a href=http://pitchfork.com/news/37233-flaming-lips-to-cover-pink-floyds-idark-sidei-live-on-new-years-eve/>would
be playing Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" at midnight</a>. The week before the concert, they released the
studio version of the album. I debated for less than five minutes whether I should listen to it or wait to hear it
live on New Year's. Of course, I caved and listened to it repeatedly. I love how they made it their own, even
completely changing the vibe of some songs like "Breathe" so that I had to really focus to hear what my ears were
used to hearing from the Floyd version. Similarly, the clocks at the beginning of "Time" and the cash register/coins
sound collage at the beginning of "Money" were changed (ha ha ha, pun intended) up quite a bit. I also appreciated
that Henry Rollins was tapped for the speaking parts interspersed throughout the album. For my American English
trained ears, this was the first time I was able to understand some of the speaking parts without the veil of a
thick British English accent.<br><br><a onblur=try{parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully()}catch{} href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Qj61m7RNFOI/Sz-qJlVag-I/AAAAAAAAAFs/GSHn8jMtq5E/s1600-h/IMG_5912+%28Small%29.JPG><img style="margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px" src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Qj61m7RNFOI/Sz-qJlVag-I/AAAAAAAAAFs/GSHn8jMtq5E/s400/IMG_5912+%28Small%29.JPG alt id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422239557994841058 border=0></a><br>Back to the concert itself... We
wisely got a room at the Renaissance Inn across the street from the convention center to avoid the need to drive
anywhere. Some friends and friends of friends joined us at the hotel before the show for a little preparty. Around
10pm, we walked across the street to the convention center. The Flaming Lips had just gone on stage and proceeded to
play a mixture of old and new songs including "Do You Realize?", "Convinced of the Hex", "She Don't Use Jelly", and
"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots".<br><br><a onblur=try{parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully()}catch{} href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Qj61m7RNFOI/Sz-qi43hWAI/AAAAAAAAAF0/eixmY94O6AA/s1600-h/IMG_5928+%28Small%29.JPG><img style="margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px" src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Qj61m7RNFOI/Sz-qi43hWAI/AAAAAAAAAF0/eixmY94O6AA/s400/IMG_5928+%28Small%29.JPG alt id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422239992734898178 border=0></a><br>Big balloons in a variety of colors
bounced among the crowd and my eyes noticed a sea of such balloons occupying the seats behind the stage. "Why aren't
these balloons being enjoyed?", I wondered. I decided to do my part and throw as many of the balloons as possible
into the part of the crowd where we were sitting. This was much appreciated by those around us, but was quickly
interrupted by the yelling of stagehands below. It was then I realized these balloons were for midnight. My bad,
dudes.<br><br>At midnight, the aforementioned idle balloons were swept into the crowd, resulting in a sea of
multicolored balloons reminiscent of the ball pit at Showbiz Pizza. After (or before, I'm not sure), Wayne came out
with giant hands and shot green lasers into the large hemispherical disco ball in the center of the arena. The disco
ball refracted the lasers everywhere and prepared us for the Flaming Lips/Pink Floyd masterpiece we were about to
witness.<br><br><a onblur=try{parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully()}catch{} href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Qj61m7RNFOI/Sz-qxcyulSI/AAAAAAAAAF8/N_x6u1R12so/s1600-h/IMG_5995+%28Small%29.JPG><img style="margin:0 auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px" src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Qj61m7RNFOI/Sz-qxcyulSI/AAAAAAAAAF8/N_x6u1R12so/s400/IMG_5995+%28Small%29.JPG alt id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422240242896639266 border=0></a><br>Before they started playing Dark
Side, Wayne asked all of us to set the alarm on our phones for 12:55 AM with whatever sound was currently set, which
was obviously when they planned to launch into "Time". No cuckoo clocks with gears and chimes in 2010; this would be
interesting.<br><br>Their performance of Dark Side for the most part stuck to the studio version, but hearing it
live and seeing a seemingly endless sea of costumed characters such as a whale in a captain's uniform dancing at the
sides of the stage made it even better. I really enjoyed watching Steven scream the diva part from "The Great Gig in
the Sky" into a distorted megaphone. The Pink Floyd version of that song always gives me chills and The Flaming Lips
version is no different. I also loved when they said "And now, we begin Side 2" in the middle of the performance.
Time to flip the record, kids... We were sitting on the left side of the stage and I didn't see Henry Rollins, but
heard his speaking parts throughout the set. Were they using a recording of him? Maybe someone with a different
vantage point can clear that up for me.<br><br>Overall, it was a great New Year's Eve. No one was shoving past
me to get to a bar and I didn't have to listen to the clucking of drunk girls in extra short cocktail dresses. I
didn't have to drive, and I didn't have to talk to any police officers.<br><br>If you haven't ever listened to
Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon", SHAME ON YOU! Go get a turntable, the record, and a good set of headphones.
Then, let me know how wonderful it is. After 100 or more listens, treat yourself to the Flaming Lips version. Which
reminds me, I still need to listen to that with headphones...<br><br>Here are a few videos:<br><br><span style=font-weight:700>Convinced of the Hex</span><br><object width=425 height=344>
