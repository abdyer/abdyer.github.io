since my last post. If I actually had some readers, this would be a bad thing. But since I don't, I guess it doesn't
really matter much. If anyone does read this drivel, please leave a comment so I can feel good about myself.
Actually, I don't need anyone to make me feel good about myself, but it would be nice to know you're reading
this.<br><br>I, like hundreds of other people yesterday ventured out to Bayou Park for the grand opening of the
<a href=http://www.houstontx.gov/parks/lee-joepark.html>Lee and Joe Jamail Skate Park</a>. For those of you who
haven't been following its construction, this is a FREE public skate park just outside of downtown. I dabbled in
skateboarding back in 6th & 7th grade and still hop on my board from time to time to ride back and forth like
I'm cool. I really feel like the old guy at the skate park, but the kids don't seem to mind and I try to stay out of
their way. I didn't skate yesterday, and instead joined the crowd around the side of the "expert" bowl. We were
treated to demos by some of the top pro skaters, most of whom I didn't recognize since I followed the sport much
more closely "back in the day". But none other than <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White>Shaun White
(Olympic gold medal snowboarder, aka The Flying Tomato)</a> was there only on a skateboard. I felt very
privileged to see him in action. Awesome!<br><br>In other news, Jamie and I saw the Old 97's at Meridian on
Friday. They played a bunch of songs from their new album. There was even a wedding proposal on stage during the
sugary sweet "Question". I'm liking their new album more and more each time I listen to it.<br><br>I also saw
the new <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/>Indiana Jones movie</a> over the weekend. It fit nicely with
the others and seemed to prepare Shia LaBeouf to take on the role of Indy in the next movie. I guess we'll see. My
only beef with the movie was the odd ending, but it is George Lucas, after all.<br><br>I finally managed to try
some of <a href=http://www.southernstarbrewery.com/>Southern Star Brewing'</a>s beer at <a href=http://www.beerknurd.com/>The Flying Saucer</a> over the weekend. Southern Star is a new brewery up near
Conroe that was started by a guy I know from my homebrew club and one of his friends. I tried their <a href=http://www.southernstarbrewery.com/SSBBeers.asp>Pine Belt Pale Ale</a> and really liked it. Hop nectar,
for sure. Good luck, guys!<br><br>Back to work...</div></span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/05/07/thoughts-on-30/>Thoughts on 30</a>
</span><span class=item__date>May 07, 2008
</span><span><div class=post>As I'm staring down 30 (tomorrow at 7:01 pm Central to be exact) I should probably blog about how awful it is, but
now that it's inevitable, I really don't think it's all that scary. I pretty much act like I'm six as often as I
can. I've worn one of my favorite t-shirts, a He-Man ringer, for years. I just recently picked up a 'Vote Optimus
08' Transformers t-shirt, too. Yep, still very much a kid. But along the way, I have learned a few
things.<br><br>The meaning of life? Enjoy it. That's all. If there's something in your life keeping you from
doing that, get rid of it. Whether it's a job you dread or people you despise, do what you can to change the
situation. An obvious exception is family. All you can do is try to get along with them.<br><br>Keeping up with
the Joneses? An utter waste of time. If your existence is so hollow that you think material possessions are a
substitute for living, figure out who you are and quit comparing yourself to others.<br><br>Music can heal all
wounds. It's a cure-all for any bad mood and the perfect complement to any good one.<br><br>What other people
think about you is irrelevant. Be yourself regardless of what others think. True happiness comes from being
surrounded by people who like you for who you are, not for living up to some ideal the shallow people try to hold
you to.<br><br>I'll add to this as I think of things, but I'd better get to bed. I need to rest up for what will
most likely be a late night of celebrating. Jamie & I are meeting some friends for dinner and drinks. And I'm
planning on taking Friday off so I won't be holding anything back.</div></span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/05/04/camping-@-pace-bend-a-new-personal-record-for-downhill-speed/>Camping @ Pace Bend & A New Personal Record For Downhill Speed!</a>

with some friends at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=pace+bend+park+austin,+tx&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=30.445936,-98.037786&amp;spn=0.040401,0.09407&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=B">Pace
Bend Park</a> next to Lake Travis, TX. For the most part, we just hung out enjoying tasty beer (<a href=http://www.saintarnold.com/>Saint Arnold</a>'s Lawnmower/Summer Pilsner/Amber and <a href=http://www.sierranevada.com/index2.asp>Sierra Nevada</a> Pale Ale for you connoisseurs), a fine <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohiba_%28cigar_brand%29>Cuban cigar</a>, and the perfect weather. One of
the highlights of the trip for me was setting a new personal record for downhill speed on our 35 mile bike ride
around the lake. Before that ride, my max downhill speed was somewhere between 40-45 mph. Yesterday, I topped out at
51.2 mph (can I get a "Hell yeah!"?) going down the biggest hill of the ride. I was literally shaking at the bottom
of the hill from the rush. What a thrill! This one downhill made up for all the grueling climbs and the slight
sunburn from the rest of the ride. I've included a picture of my bike computer as proof.<br><br>I'd say the only
downside of the trip was the inconsiderate jackasses who insisted on blaring their music in the wee hours of the
night both Friday and Saturday. Why do these people always listen to the crappiest music? We heard a mind-numbing
mix of horrid techno and the most cliched 80's rock ballads at ridiculous volumes. I'd much prefer to go to sleep to
the sounds of nature.<br><br>Today on the way out of Austin, we stopped for brunch at <a href=http://www.cafemagnolia.com/>Magnolia Cafe</a>. It was my first time to eat there and it's now another
place on my growing list of great restaurants to visit when in our state's capital city.</div></span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/04/19/up-at-600-am-on-a-saturday.../>Up at 6:00 am on a Saturday...</a>
</span><span class=item__date>Apr 19, 2008
</span><span><div class=post>So I'm up at 6:00 am on a Saturday morning about to go meet some friends for a bike ride. We'll be doing at least 25
miles, but maybe 50 if we feel up for it. Crazy I know, but there's a certain excitement around getting up early,
eating a carbolicious breakfast, drinking some coffee, and hitting the road for awhile. My only real complaint is
how much gear is involved in a simple bike ride. For those of you who have read Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World"
(if not, I highly recommend it), cycling is like one of those sports mentioned in the book that requires an arsenal
of equipment to participate. A short list of things I've assembled for this morning's ride include: cycling
jersey/shorts/shoes, heart rate monitor, helmet, gloves, sunglasses, spare bike tubes/CO2 cartridges, energy bars,
energy gels, Gatorade, water, recovery drink. Insane, huh?</span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/04/18/son-volt-with-bobby-bare-jr.-@-the-continental-club-negativland-@-rices-aurora-picture-show/>Son Volt with Bobby Bare Jr. @ The Continental Club, Negativland @ Rice's Aurora Picture Show</a>

two days. Wednesday night, I went to see <a href=http://www.myspace.com/sonvolt>Son Volt</a> at The Continental
Club. For those who are not familiar with the band, Jay Farrar the lead singer/song writer, was previously in Uncle
Tupelo (forefathers of the "No Depression"/alt-country genre) and one of my favorite bands - <a href=http://www.myspace.com/wilco>Wilco</a>. There was a bit of a falling out between him and Jeff Tweedy
during the recording of the epic "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" album and Son Volt was born. Son Volt put on a great show.
Their lead guitar player was a virtuoso, playing flawlessly with perfect tone.<br><br><a href=http://www.myspace.com/bobbybarejr>Bobby Bare Jr</a> opened. I hadn't heard of him previously but really
liked his songs. The bass player was hilarious. He had on a "Daniel-san" like headband and danced around like he was
playing butt rock rather than sensitive alt-country. He cracked me up when he asked for "more mustache" in the
monitors!<br><br>Last night, I had the pleasure of experiencing <a href=http://www.myspace.com/officialnegativland>Negativland</a> at <a href=http://www.aurorapictureshow.org/>Rice's Aurora Picture Show</a> after a friend invited me to check it
out. The show can best be described as a fictional radio show examining religion. The show was titled "It's All In
Your Head" and posits that religion, like everything else, is man made. By design, it is intended to make listeners
question their beliefs and compare/contrast them with other religions. To enhance the listening experience, the
audience was given a colorful piñata blindfold and invited to wear it throughout the show. I took their suggestion
and zoned out a bit as I soaked up the chaotic sound collage they created live on stage. One of the members of the
group said no computers were used to produce the show, just an array of electronics equipment including samplers,
turntables, and other "complicated devices". This was very different than anything I'd ever been to but I thoroughly
enjoyed it.<br><br>Before the show, we wandered around the Rice campus a bit until we found <a href=http://valhalla.rice.edu/>Valhalla</a>, an on-campus bar run by grad students. The beer was ridiculously
cheap. I drank St. Arnold Bock for $1.15 a glass. I'll always love the Gingerman, but I may have found another
option when in that area. The campus was beautiful. I'd never been there, but walking around made me want to go back
to school again. Maybe someday soon. The whole studying thing doesn't appeal to me at the moment.<br><br>I'm
supposed to be working now, so I'd better wrap this up. I've included a picture I took in a friend of a friend's
apartment building. I think it speaks for itself.</div></span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://andydyer.org/blog/2008/04/15/all-the-cool-kids-are-doing-it/>All the cool kids are doing it</a>
